       Dec 28 (Reuters) - Iranian-backed Houthi militants in
Yemen have stepped up attacks on vessels in the Red Sea to show
their support for Palestinian Islamist group Hamas fighting
Israel in Gaza.
    The attacks, targeting a route that allows East-West trade,
especially of oil, to use the Suez Canal to save the time and
expense of circumnavigating Africa, prompted some shipping
companies to reroute vessels earlier in December.
    Others, now encouraged by the deployment of a U.S.-led
military operation, are resuming crossings of the area.
    Below are companies' reactions (in alphabetical order) to
the situation in the Red Sea:

    C.H. ROBINSON <CHRW.O> 
    The global logistics group said on Dec. 22 it had rerouted
more than 25 vessels around the Cape of Good Hope over the past
week, and that number would likely continue to grow.
    ""Blank sailings and rate increases are expected to continue
across many trades into Q1 of 2024,"" it added.

    CMA CGM
    The French shipping group is planning a gradual increase in
the number of vessels transiting the Suez Canal, it said on Dec.
26. ""This decision is based on an in-depth evaluation of the
security landscape and our commitment to the security and safety
of our seafarers,"" CMA CGM said in a statement.
     The company had previously rerouted several vessels via the
Cape of Good Hope.

    EURONAV <EUAV.BR> 
    The Belgian oil tanker firm said on Dec. 18 it would avoid
the Red Sea area until further notice.

    EVERGREEN <2603.TW> 
    The Taiwanese container shipping line said on Dec. 18 its
vessels on regional services to Red Sea ports would sail to safe
waters nearby and wait for further notification, while ships
scheduled to pass through the Red Sea would be rerouted around
the Cape of Good Hope. It also temporarily stopped accepting
Israeli cargo.

    FRONTLINE <FRO.OL> 
    The Norway-based oil tanker group said on Dec. 18 that its
vessels would avoid passages through the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden.

    GRAM CAR CARRIERS <GCC.OL>
    The Norwegian shipping company, which specialises in pure
car truck carriers, said on Dec. 21 its vessels were restricted
from passing through the Red Sea.

    HAPAG-LLOYD <HLAG.DE> 
    The German container shipping line said on Dec. 21 it would
reroute 25 ships by the end of the year to avoid the Suez Canal
and the Red Sea, adding it would take further decisions at the
end of the year.
    A projectile believed to be a drone struck one of its
vessels sailing close to the coast of Yemen on Dec. 15. No crew
were injured.

    HMM <011200.KS> 
    The South Korean container shipper said on Dec. 19 it had
ordered its ships from Europe that would normally use the Suez
Canal to reroute via the Cape of Good Hope for an indefinite
period of time from Dec. 15.

    HOEGH AUTOLINERS <HAUTO.OL>
    The Norwegian shipping company said on Dec. 20 it would stop
Red Sea transit after the Norwegian Maritime Authority raised
its alert for the southern part of the sea to the highest level.
    
    KLAVENESS COMBINATION CARRIERS <KCCK.OL> 
    The Norway-based fleet operator said on Thursday it was
unlikely to sail any of its vessels in the Red Sea, unless the
situation improves. 

    MAERSK <MAERSKb.CO>
    The Danish shipping group said on Dec. 27 it had scheduled
several dozen container vessels to travel via the Suez Canal and
the Red Sea in the coming days and weeks.
    It had earlier said it was preparing to let vessels return
to the Red Sea after the deployment of the U.S.-led military
operation.
        
  

    MSC
    Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) said on Dec. 16 its
ships would not transit through the Suez Canal, with some
already rerouted via the Cape of Good Hope, a day after two
ballistic missiles were fired at its vessel.

    OCEAN NETWORK EXPRESS
    Ocean Network Express (ONE), a joint venture of Japan's
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines <9104.T>, Nippon Yusen <9101.T> and Kawasaki
Kisen Kaisha <9107.T>, said on Dec. 19 it would reroute vessels
away from the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. Instead, its ships
will navigate around the Cape of Good Hope or temporarily pause
their journey and move to safe areas.

    OOCL
    The Hong Kong-headquartered container group said on Dec. 21
it had guided its vessels to either divert route or suspend
sailing to the Red Sea. The company, owned by Orient Overseas
(International) Ltd <0316.HK>, has also stopped cargo acceptance
to and from Israel until further notice.

    WALLENIUS WILHELMSEN <WAWI.OL> 
    The Norwegian shipping group said on Dec. 19 it would halt
Red Sea transits until further notice. Rerouting vessels via the
Cape of Good Hope will add 1-2 weeks to voyage durations, it
said.

    YANG MING MARINE TRANSPORT <2609.TW> 
    The Taiwanese container shipping company said on Dec. 18 it
would divert ships sailing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden via the Cape of Good Hope for the next two weeks.

2023,CHRW.OQ,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20231222:nL1N3DH0MM:14,2023-12-22 15:17:48.000,UPDATE 3-Shipping firms impose extra fees as Red Sea attacks hit global trade,"(Adds Hapag Lloyd in paragraphs 3, 7)
    By Terje Solsvik and Gus Trompiz
       OSLO/PARIS, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Some of the world's
largest shipping firms, including Maersk <MAERSKb.CO> and CMA
CGM, will impose extra charges after they re-routed ships in
response to attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, as worries about
disruption to global trade grow.
    The surcharges, designed to cover longer voyages around
Africa compared with routes via the Suez Canal, will add to
rising costs for sea transport since Yemen's Houthi militant
group started targeting vessels.
    Maersk and CMA CGM were the first to introduce the fees,
followed by Germany's Hapag-Lloyd <HLAG.DE> later on Friday.
    The three are among leading shipping lines to have suspended
the passage of vessels through the Red Sea that connects with
the Suez Canal, the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe.
    Instead, they are directing ships around the Cape of Good
Hope at the southern tip of Africa, adding about 10 days to a
journey that would normally take about 27 days from China to
northern Europe.
    Citing ""severe operational disruption"", Maersk said late on
Thursday it was imposing an immediate transit disruption
surcharge (TDS) to cover extra costs associated with the longer
journey, plus a peak season surcharge (PSS) from Jan. 1.
    Hapag-Lloyd has said it would redirect 25 ships by the end
of the year to avoid the area.
    On Friday, Chinese automaker Geely <0175.HK> told Reuters
its electric vehicle sales were likely to be hurt by a delay in
deliveries to Europe, the latest company to warn of disruption.
    China's second largest automaker by sales said most of the
shipping firms it uses for European exports have plans to go
around southern Africa.
    The alert bodes ill for other automakers in China as they
seek to increase exports to Europe due to overcapacity and weak
demand at home.
    The United States has announced a multinational force to
patrol the Red Sea, but shipping sources say details have yet to
emerge and companies continue to avoid the area.
    In a message to customers, logistics firm CH Robinson
Worldwide <CHRW.O> said it had re-routed more than 25 vessels to
southern Africa over the past week.
    ""That number will likely continue to grow due to ongoing war
risks in the Red Sea and the drought in the Panama Canal,"" it
said.
    SURCHARGES
    CH Robinson said cancellations and rate increases were
expected to continue into the first quarter and recommended
customers book 4-6 weeks in advance to ensure space on vessels. 
    Maersk said a standard 20-foot container travelling from
China to Northern Europe now faced total extra charges of $700,
consisting of a $200 TDS and $500 PSS.
    Containers bound for the east coast of North America will be
charged $500 each, consisting of the $200 TDS payment and a $300
PSS, the company added.
    Maersk also said routes in other parts of its network would
be affected by the Suez disruption, triggering emergency
contingency surcharges on a wide range of journeys.
    CMA CGM announced surcharges late on Thursday including an
extra $325 per 20-foot container on the North Europe to Asia
route and $500 per 20-foot container for Asia to the
Mediterranean.
    The charges were part of its contingency plan to re-route
vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, it said.
    France-based CMA CGM listed 22 of its vessels as having been
re-routed.
