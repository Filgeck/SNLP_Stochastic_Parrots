Video Transcript:

Warren Buffett's appetite these days consists of more pizza and less Apple, at
least when it comes to stocks. His Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in regulatory
documents that the Omaha-based conglomerate made a new investment in Domino's
Pizza, while continuing to trim its position in Apple. The SEC filing showed
that Berkshire owned nearly 1.3 million shares of Domino's, worth about $545
million as of September 3. Berkshire also took a dip into Pool Corporation,
amassing about $152 million worth of shares in the swimming pool supplies
distributor. On the flip side, Berkshire said it has sold more than $133
billion worth of stocks this year, primarily Apple, followed by Bank of
America, as Buffett continues to amass cash. Buffett hasn't said definitively
why Berkshire is cutting back on stocks, though taxes may be a factor.
Investors have said he may believe valuations have grown too high. The cash
also gives Berkshire, whose market value is about $1 trillion, room to still
make a needle-moving acquisition, while the 94-year-old Oracle of Omaha
remains in charge."

 (Adds additional portfolio changes, Domino's and Pool
after-hours stock prices, byline)
    By Jonathan Stempel
       Nov 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
<BRKa.N> said on Thursday it made new investments in Domino's
Pizza <DPZ.N> and Pool Corp <POOL.O> in the third quarter, even
as it retrenched from stocks such as Apple <AAPL.O> and Bank of
America <BAC.N>.
    Berkshire owned 1.28 million Domino's shares worth about
$549 million as of Sept. 30. It also owned 404,000 shares of
Pool, a distributor of swimming pool supplies, worth about $152
million as of that date.
    The investments were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed
investments as of Sept. 30.
        Domino's shares rose 6.9% and Pool shares rose 5.7%
after market hours following Berkshire's disclosures.
  
    Shares often rise after Berkshire reveals new investments,
reflecting investors' belief that Buffett may be providing a
seal of approval.
    Thursday's filing does not say whether Buffett or his
portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are responsible
for individual investments.
    Neither Domino's nor Pool immediately responded to requests
for comment.
        Like chains such as McDonald's <MCD.N>, Domino's has
been conducting 
    more promotions
     to attract value-oriented diners, including those shunning
higher-priced sit-down chains in favor of upscale fast food or
home delivery.
  
        Pool, meanwhile, last month said 
    demand
     for non-discretionary repair and maintenance services for
existing pools partially offset ""soft"" demand for new pool
construction.
  
        Berkshire made the investments even as Buffett amasses
cash.
        The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has in 2024
nearly doubled its 
    stake in cash and equivalents
     to $325.2 billion as of Sept. 30, and even halted
repurchases of its own stock for the first time since 2018.
  
        Berkshire sold $36.1 billion of stocks and bought just
$1.5 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. For the year,
Berkshire has sold $133.2 billion of stocks -- primarily Apple,
followed by Bank of America -- and bought just $5.8 billion.
  
        Buffett hasn't said definitively why Berkshire is
cutting back, though 
    taxes
     may be a factor. Investors have said he may believe
valuations have grown too high.
  
        The cash also gives Berkshire, whose market value is
about $1.01 trillion, room to still make a needle-moving
acquisition while Buffett, 94, remains in charge.
  
        During the quarter, Berkshire also added to its holdings
in aircraft parts maker Heico <HEI.N>.
  
        It sold its entire stake in flooring retailer Floor &
Decor <FND.N> and some shares of Capital One <COF.N>, Charter
Communications <CHTR.O>, Brazilian digital bank operator Nu
Holdings <NU.N> and cosmetics chain Ulta Beauty <ULTA.O>.
  
        The sale of more than 96% of its Ulta shares marked a
quick turnaround for Berkshire, which first 
    disclosed
     investing in Ulta in August. Ulta shares fell 3.8% after
hours.
  
        Berkshire also owns dozens of companies including Geico
car insurance, the BNSF railroad and a variety of consumer,
energy, industrial and retail businesses.

profit estimates on Thursday on continued demand for its pool
repair and maintenance services.
    That helped the pool products distributor offset pressure in
its discretionary product segment, which includes irrigation and
landscape products, as consumers cutback spending on
non-essential items. 
     The company reiterated its 2024 profit outlook to be in the
range of $11.06 per share to $11.46 per share. 
    Quarterly adjusted profit of $3.26 per share beat analysts'
estimate of $3.14, according to LSEG compiled data.
    Revenue for the quarter ended September 30 came in at $1.43
billion, compared with estimates of $1.40 billion.

for second-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by steady demand
for its pool repair and maintenance services.
    Pool posted an adjusted profit of $4.98 per share for the
quarter ended June 30, above analysts' estimates of $4.90 per
share, according to LSEG data.
        The Covington, Louisiana-based company is a wholesale
distributor of swimming pool supplies and equipment. It also
sells irrigation and landscaping products.
    ""The demand for maintenance products supported a solid
quarter given the trend for lower consumer spending on high
dollar discretionary items,"" said CEO Peter Arvan.
        The company reported net sales of $1.78 billion for the
quarter, surpassing analysts' estimates of $1.74 billion.

full-year profit forecast on Thursday, as the company expects
sales and gross margin trends to improve with a return to
seasonal buying patterns. 
    The pool products distributor now sees diluted earnings per
share for 2024 between $13.19 and $14.19, compared with its
earlier forecast of $13.10 to $14.10 per share.
    The Covington, Louisiana-based company bills itself as the
world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies
and equipment. It also sells irrigation and landscape products.
    ""We remain confident in the growth opportunities available
through continuous improved execution, strategic product and
software additions, targeted expansion and selected
acquisitions,"" said CEO Peter Arvan.
     The company, however, missed Wall Street estimates for
first quarter adjusted profit on back of softening demand for
its pool equipment.
        It reported an adjusted profit of $1.85 per share,
missing analysts' average expectation of $1.91 per share for the
quarter, according to LSEG data.
  
        High interest rates and sticky inflation in the quarter
affected new housing construction, impacting demand for the
company's pool and landscaping products.
  
        It reported net sales of $1.12 billion. Analysts on
average, had expected it to post net sales of $1.13 billion.

    ** Christoph Greulich from Berenberg said Fluidra's stock

pocketed quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.32​​ per share for

    ** ""It seems like the outlook was somewhat below where the
consensus expectations were like,"" Greulich says, adding
historically Fluidra's shares tended to react to when PoolCorp
was reporting
    ** ""Pool delivered a slight beat in 4Q but announced 
guidance below consensus at midpoint, on weaker than expected 
top-line and a lower than expected operating margin,"" Jefferies

    ** Fluidra's FY 2023 results are due on Feb. 29

estimates for fourth-quarter profit on Thursday as strength in
its pool maintenance services offset weak consumer spending on
big-ticket purchases like swimming pools.
    The Covington, Louisiana-based company, which trades under
PoolCorp, bill itself as the world's largest wholesale
distributor of swimming pool supplies and related equipment. It
also sells irrigation and landscape products.
    New residential pool construction permits were lower as the
high interest rates have put off consumers taking on significant
financial debt in an uncertain economy.
    The company was able to offset inflationary headwinds by
expanding on its product portfolio, adding new services and
diversifying its customer base.
    On an adjusted basis, Pool reported a profit of $1.32 per
share, beating analysts' average expectation of $1.25 per share,
according to LSEG data.
    Revenue at the company, which has operations in North
America, Europe and Australia, was $1 billion, compared with
$1.1 billion reported a year ago.
    The pool-maker expects diluted earnings per share for the
year 2024 between $13.10 and $14.10, compared with analysts'
estimates of $14.10, as per LSEG data.
