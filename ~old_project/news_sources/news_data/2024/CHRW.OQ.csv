    By Lisa Baertlein
       LOS ANGELES, Dec 13 (Reuters) - President-elect Donald
Trump's threatened tariffs on top trade partners China, Mexico
and Canada would deal a blow to the $1.7 trillion U.S.
transportation industry and worsen a nearly three-year trucking
recession, sector experts said.
    The industry that moves everything Americans make and buy is
considered an economic bellwether, and will be among the first
to signal any unintended consequences of trade policies that
Trump says will help, not hurt, U.S. businesses.
    ""Tariffs like those proposed will raise prices, and higher
prices mean less demand. Less demand equals less freight,"" said
Jason Miller, interim chair of the department of supply-chain
management at Michigan State University's business college.
    Virtually every transportation company operating in the
United States is exposed to tariff-related revenue downturns.
The biggest include trucking and delivery firms J.B. Hunt
Transport Services <JBHT.O> and United Parcel Service <UPS.N> as
well as railroad operators Canadian Pacific Kansas City <CP.TO>
and Union Pacific <UNP.N>.
    J.B. Hunt did not respond to requests for comment and UPS
declined comment. The railroad operators said they were prepared
to respond when and if tariffs come through.
Trump is keen to use tariffs to create jobs and raise revenue to
replace that will be lost with planned tax cuts, even though
those import levies would in effect serve as a new tax on
consumers, whose spending represents the country's most powerful
economic driver.
But he also appears to be using tariff threats to force U.S.
trade partners to relent on nontrade issues like border
security, economists and transportation executives said. China
and other U.S. trade partners have not backed down, saying the
tariffs would serve only to hurt all involved.
    Trump has said he would slap tariffs of 25% on goods from
Mexico and Canada unless those governments crack down on the
flow of immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S. He has also vowed
to add tariffs of at least 10% on top of what is already imposed
on Chinese goods.
    The United States is the world's No. 1 importer and No. 2
exporter. Trump's threatened tariffs would decrease flows in
both directions, said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow of the
Peterson Institute for International Economics, who studies the
impact of the U.S.-China trade war.  
    ""We expect that the new administration will get to work
right away,"" said Lovely, who added that Trump's new tariffs
could start hitting in the second or third quarters of next
year.
     
    TRUMP TARIFFS - THE SEQUEL
    Trucking accounts for about one-third of U.S.
transportation, more than any other sector.
    Tariffs imposed by Trump during his previous term
contributed to a trucking recession that lasted for most of
2019.  
    ""We've seen this movie before, so we know how this plays
out,"" said Dean Croke, principal analyst at DAT Freight and
Analytics <ROP.O>, which connects trucking firms with shippers. 
    ""All I see is more disruption and tit-for-tat tariffs,""
Croke said, echoing a broadly held sentiment in transportation.
    U.S. trucking is in a down cycle that has lasted nearly
three years, the longest and deepest since the global financial
crisis, said Michael Castagnetto, president of North American
surface transportation at C.H. Robinson Worldwide <CHRW.O>.
    Any new import levies are on a collision course with
stubbornly flat industrial production - a crucial driver of
domestic and international volume from sectors that include
mining, manufacturing, chemicals and electricity - and lingering
overcapacity from the COVID shipping boom, experts said.
    Trump's new tariffs on Mexico and Canada, in particular,
would hit one of the rare growth areas for trucking. 
The value of cargo that moves between those countries and the
U.S. - which includes finished vehicles, auto parts and avocados
from Mexico as well as steel and lumber from Canada - reached
$88.5 billion in September 2024, up 7.7% from the year-earlier,
according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of
Transportation Statistics (BTS). 
    ""Many of our customers – especially automotive customers –
treat North America as one integrated supply chain, with some of
their freight actually crossing both the Mexico and Canada
borders,"" C.H. Robinson's Castagnetto said.
That interrelation makes the U.S. vulnerable to retaliatory
tariffs. 
     
    TRANS-BORDER TRADE
    Trump's tariff threats could also derail railroad company
plans to switch from cost-reductions and efficiency efforts to
growth, said independent railroad analyst Anthony Hatch.
    North American trans-border rail freight was $17 billion in
September, down 5.4% from the year earlier, according to BTS
data, but remains an opportunity for the industry.
    Canadian Pacific bought Kansas City Southern for $31 billion
in 2021, merging the companies into an entity known as CPKC and
creating the first railway to link Canada, the United States and
Mexico. The merged companies aimed to capitalize on China's
factory expansion in Mexico, which recently overtook China as
the No. 1 U.S. trade partner.
    ""While there was rhetoric and headlines, ultimately free
trade in North America increased significantly during the first
Trump term and a new free trade agreement was established,"" a
CPKC spokesman said. 
    Union Pacific, which covers much of the U.S. West, also has
connections to and investments in Mexico.
    ""If it slows down, we have the capability to remove a lot of
costs,"" Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena said at a recent investor
conference, referring to any tariff-related demand downturn.

    By Ankika Biswas, Pranav Kashyap
       Nov 5 (Reuters) - As Americans go to the polls to elect
a new president, investors are trying to gauge how stock markets
will react as polls and betting platforms point to a tight race
between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald
Trump.
    Harris' lead over the Republican has dwindled to a single
percentage point in the final stretch of the presidential
contest, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on
Tuesday. 
A majority of a dozen analysts that Reuters spoke to expect a
Trump return to boost equity markets, with some favoring a split
government.
    Crypto stocks and small-caps have gained in the lead up to
the election.
  
    Trump's pledge to cut corporate taxes and decrease
regulations could boost markets in the short-term if he wins,
said Bel Air Investment Advisors Chairman Todd Morgan.
  
     On the other hand, Trump has promised to 
    double down on trade tariffs
    , especially against China, and ""
    rescind
     all unspent funds"" under a signature Biden-Harris climate
law that includes hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies
for electric vehicles, solar and other clean energy
technologies.
  
    A divided Congress may be the best outcome as it limits what
the president can accomplish and spend, according to Brian
Klimke, chief market strategist at Cetera Investment Management.
     
    Here's a list of stocks and sectors that could move on the
election outcome:
     
    TRUMP TRADE
  
     
  
BANKS: A Trump win or Republican sweep could lift Wall Street
banks such as JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N>, Bank of America <BAC.N>
and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> on improved domestic investment, looser
regulations, domestic job additions and tax cuts, Bank of
America analysts said. 
However, concerns around a wider trade deficit and tariffs are
viewed as negative for the sector.
M&A beneficiaries include Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley
<MS.N>, Lazard <LAZ.N> and Evercore <EVR.N> amid a more lenient
approach to antitrust regulation enforcement. 
     
CRYPTO: A more ""receptive"" regulatory approach to digital assets
under a Trump win could benefit crypto stocks, according to TD
Cowen analysts who highlighted the likelihood of the former
president naming a pro-crypto SEC chair.
MicroStrategy <MSTR.O>, Riot Platforms <RIOT.O>, MARA Holdings
<MARA.O>, Hut 8 <HUT.O> and Bit Digital <BTBT.O> climbed between
3.4% and 45% in October.
     
ENERGY: Morgan Stanley analysts believe a Trump presidency could
prioritize reducing the regulatory burden on domestic oil and
gas production, while considering the possibility of more
restrictive trade policies.
    ""Trump's support for fossil fuel industries could benefit
oil and gas stocks, as he would likely pursue policies that
favor domestic energy production,"" said Daniela Hathorn, senior
market analyst at Capital.com.
    Trump could leverage authority to rapidly increase
production levels, which would benefit exploration companies
such as Chevron <CVX.N>, Exxon Mobil <XOM.N>, and ConocoPhillips
<COP.N>.
    He could also reverse the Biden administration's pause on
permitting new LNG export projects, likely benefiting Baker
Hughes <BKR.N> and Chart Industries <GTLS.N>. However, Trump's
proposed 60% tariff on imports from China could hit LNG
exporters like Cheniere Energy <LNG.N> and New Fortress Energy
<NFE.O> in case of any retaliatory actions.
     
TRUMP-RELATED STOCKS: Trump Media & Technology Group <DJT.O>, in
which Trump owns a majority stake, software firm Phunware
<PHUN.O> and video-sharing platform Rumble <RUM.O> stand to gain
further if he wins. Both Phunware and Trump Media & Technology
have doubled in October after sluggish performance in recent
months. 
     
    PRISON OPERATORS: Geo Group <GEO.N> and CoreCivic <CXW.N>
may benefit from Trump's re-election, on promises of a crackdown
on illegal immigration and restrictions on legal immigration,
which could boost demand for detention centers.
     
CARRIERS: Wells Fargo analysts said the proposed tariff on
Chinese imports under a Trump term could hurt demand for parcel
carriers FedEx <FDX.N> and United Parcel Service <UPS.N>, and
forwarder C.H. Robinson Worldwide <CHRW.O>, which have
substantial exposure to China. 
     
SMALL-CAP STOCKS: U.S.-focused companies could benefit from
business incentives and tariffs that favor domestic production.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index <.RUT> has risen nearly 9% so
far in 2024.
     
    HARRIS BASKET 
  
     
HOMEBUILDERS: Harris' pledge to build more homes and reduce
costs for renters and home buyers largely through tax
incentives, coupled with a benign interest-rate environment,
could boost homebuilders D.R. Horton <DHI.N>, KB Home <KBH.N>,
Lennar <LEN.N>, PulteGroup <PHM.N>, Zillow Group <ZG.O> and Toll
Brothers <TOL.N>.  
        
HEALTHCARE: The sector has been a key focus for the Harris
campaign. 
She has pledged to cut healthcare costs by implementing caps on
prescription drug prices, such as limiting insulin prices to
$35. This could weigh on profit margins for pharmaceutical
giants such as Eli Lilly <LLY.N>, Merck <MRK.N>, and Pfizer
<PFE.N>. 
Andrew Wells, CIO of SanJac Alpha, however, expects healthcare
insurers such as Humana <HUM.N> and UnitedHealth Group <UNH.N>
to likely benefit from expanded coverage under a Harris
presidency.
     
CORPORATE TAXES: Harris' proposal to tax corporations and the
wealthy includes a 28% corporate tax rate and that could help
the U.S. deficit. 
According to Stock Analysis, Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Apple <AAPL.O>,
and Alphabet <GOOGL.O> were the three firms shouldering the
highest income taxes over the past 12 months, collectively
amounting to $67.73 billion. 
    ""It is highly unlikely to see a blue wave, but if that
happens, the market reaction could be temporarily negative due
to the prospects of higher corporate tax rates,"" said Cetera's
Klimke.         
     
RENEWABLE STOCKS: Green energy is poised to thrive under Harris,
with the potential for increased incentives and supportive
policies as well as regulations on big oil firms, according to
Capital.com's Hathorn. 
Harris will aim to significantly reduce pollution by 2035,
aligning with the Paris Agreement — a climate pact Trump has
vowed to withdraw.
Major U.S. renewable energy firms such as NextEra Energy <NEE.N>
and hydrogen producers including Plug Power <PLUG.N> and Bloom
Energy <BE.N> could also benefit.

banks such as JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N>, Bank of America <BAC.N>
and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> on improved domestic investment, looser
regulations, domestic job additions and tax cuts, Bank of
America analysts said. 
However, concerns around a wider trade deficit and tariffs are
viewed as negative for the sector.
M&A beneficiaries include Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley
<MS.N>, Lazard <LAZ.N> and Evercore <EVR.N> amid a more lenient
approach to antitrust regulation enforcement. 
     
CRYPTO: A more ""receptive"" regulatory approach to digital assets
under a Trump win could benefit crypto stocks, according to TD
Cowen analysts who highlighted the likelihood of the former
president naming a pro-crypto SEC chair.
MicroStrategy <MSTR.O>, Riot Platforms <RIOT.O>, MARA Holdings
<MARA.O>, Hut 8 <HUT.O> and Bit Digital <BTBT.O> climbed between
3.4% and 45% in October.
     
ENERGY: Morgan Stanley analysts believe a Trump presidency could
prioritize reducing the regulatory burden on domestic oil and
gas production, while considering the possibility of more
restrictive trade policies.
    ""Trump's support for fossil fuel industries could benefit
oil and gas stocks, as he would likely pursue policies that
favor domestic energy production,"" said Daniela Hathorn, senior
market analyst at Capital.com.
    Trump could leverage authority to rapidly increase
production levels, which would benefit exploration companies
such as Chevron <CVX.N>, Exxon Mobil <XOM.N>, and ConocoPhillips
<COP.N>.
    He could also reverse the Biden administration's pause on
permitting new LNG export projects, likely benefiting Baker
Hughes <BKR.N> and Chart Industries <GTLS.N>. However, Trump's
proposed 60% tariff on imports from China could hit LNG
exporters like Cheniere Energy <LNG.N> and New Fortress Energy
<NFE.O> in case of any retaliatory actions.
     
TRUMP-RELATED STOCKS: Trump Media & Technology Group <DJT.O>, in
which Trump owns a majority stake, software firm Phunware
<PHUN.O> and video-sharing platform Rumble <RUM.O> stand to gain
further if he wins. Both Phunware and Trump Media & Technology
have doubled in October after sluggish performance in recent
months. 
     
    PRISON OPERATORS: Geo Group <GEO.N> and CoreCivic <CXW.N>
may benefit from Trump's re-election, on promises of a crackdown
on illegal immigration and restrictions on legal immigration,
which could boost demand for detention centers.
     
CARRIERS: Wells Fargo analysts said the proposed tariff on
Chinese imports under a Trump term could hurt demand for parcel
carriers FedEx <FDX.N> and United Parcel Service <UPS.N>, and
forwarder C.H. Robinson Worldwide <CHRW.O>, which have
substantial exposure to China. 
     
SMALL-CAP STOCKS: U.S.-focused companies could benefit from
business incentives and tariffs that favor domestic production.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index <.RUT> has risen nearly 9% so
far in 2024.
     
    HARRIS BASKET 
  
     
HOMEBUILDERS: Harris' pledge to build more homes and reduce
costs for renters and home buyers largely through tax
incentives, coupled with a benign interest-rate environment,
could boost homebuilders D.R. Horton <DHI.N>, KB Home <KBH.N>,
Lennar <LEN.N>, PulteGroup <PHM.N>, Zillow Group <ZG.O> and Toll
Brothers <TOL.N>.  
        
HEALTHCARE: The sector has been a key focus for the Harris
campaign. 
She has pledged to cut healthcare costs by implementing caps on
prescription drug prices, such as limiting insulin prices to
$35. This could weigh on profit margins for pharmaceutical
giants such as Eli Lilly <LLY.N>, Merck <MRK.N>, and Pfizer
<PFE.N>. 
Andrew Wells, CIO of SanJac Alpha, however, expects healthcare
insurers such as Humana <HUM.N> and UnitedHealth Group <UNH.N>
to likely benefit from expanded coverage under a Harris
presidency.
     
CORPORATE TAXES: Harris' proposal to tax corporations and the
wealthy includes a 28% corporate tax rate and that could help
the U.S. deficit. 
According to Stock Analysis, Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Apple <AAPL.O>,
and Alphabet <GOOGL.O> were the three firms shouldering the
highest income taxes over the past 12 months, collectively
amounting to $67.73 billion. 
    ""It is highly unlikely to see a blue wave, but if that
happens, the market reaction could be temporarily negative due
to the prospects of higher corporate tax rates,"" said Cetera's
Klimke.         
     
RENEWABLE STOCKS: Green energy is poised to thrive under Harris,
with the potential for increased incentives and supportive
policies as well as regulations on big oil firms, according to
Capital.com's Hathorn. 
Harris will aim to significantly reduce pollution by 2035,
aligning with the Paris Agreement — a climate pact Trump has
vowed to withdraw.
Major U.S. renewable energy firms such as NextEra Energy <NEE.N>
and hydrogen producers including Plug Power <PLUG.N> and Bloom
Energy <BE.N> could also benefit.

       Nov 1 (Reuters) - Just days ahead of the Nov. 5
presidential election in the U.S., investors are trying to gauge
how stock markets will react as polls and betting platforms
point to a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and
former President Donald Trump.    
    Harris' lead over the Republican has dwindled to a single
percentage point in the final stretch of the presidential
contest, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday.
    A majority of a dozen analysts that Reuters spoke to expect
a Trump return to boost equity markets, with some favoring a
split government.
    Crypto stocks and small-caps have gained in the lead up to
the election.
    Trump's pledge to cut corporate taxes and decrease
regulations could boost markets in the short-term if he wins,
said Bel Air Investment Advisors Chairman Todd Morgan.
        On the other hand, Trump has promised to 
    double down on trade tariffs
    , especially against China, and ""
    rescind
     all unspent funds"" under a signature Biden-Harris climate
law that includes hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies
for electric vehicles, solar and other clean energy
technologies.
  
    A divided Congress may be the best outcome as it limits what
the president can accomplish and spend, according to Brian
Klimke, chief market strategist at Cetera Investment Management.
    
    Here's a list of stocks and sectors that could move on the
election outcome:

estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on Wednesday,
helped by the logistics firm's efforts to reduce costs and
higher pricing in its ocean services business.
    Adjusted gross profits in the company's ocean freight
business rose by 57.4% over a year, driven by a 47% increase in
adjusted gross profit per shipment and a 7% increase in
shipments, in general.
    The ongoing geo-political tensions in the Red Sea and
disruption due to strikes at U.S. East and Gulf coast ports
helped freight forwarders in increasing shipping charges.
    Despite a prolonged slump in demand and low shipment
volumes, logistics companies are focusing on improving their
profit margins.
        ""We improved the quality of our volume in the third
quarter and continued to expand our North American surface
transportation (segment) gross profit margin,"" said CEO Dave
Bozeman said.
    The Minnesota-based company posted an adjusted income of
$1.28 per share for the quarter ended September 30, compared
with analysts' average expectations of $1.15, according to data
compiled by LSEG.
    Total revenue rose 7% to $4.64 billion, driven by higher
pricing and volume in its ocean services business, beating
analysts' estimates of $4.53 billion.

2024,CHRW.OQ,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20241002:nL4N3LE0F4:7,2024-10-02 07:41:02.000,FACTBOX-Companies have planned for US East Coast ports strike,"(Adds Ahold Delhaize)
       Oct 2 (Reuters) - Some 45,000 union workers walked off
the job at seaports on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts on Oct. 1,
cutting off vital trade arteries just weeks ahead of the
nation's presidential election.
    The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) union,
which represents dockworkers across 36 ports on the U.S. East
Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, remains deadlocked with the United
States Maritime Alliance (USMX) employer group on wage issues.
    The stoppage is the first coast-wide ILA strike since 1977
and halts the flow of about half the nation's ocean shipping. A
two-week strike could mean that ports would not return to normal
operations until 2025, according to Sea-Intelligence, a
Copenhagen-based shipping advisory firm.
    Here is what global companies and stakeholders have said
regarding a potential strike:
     
 Costco          U.S. retailer Costco's contingency plans
 Wholesale       include pre-shipping some products to get in
 <COST.O>        holiday goods early and preparing to use
                 different ports, Costco's CEO Ron Vachris
                 said last week.
 Maersk          The Danish shipping and logistics giant said
 <MAERSKb.CO>    on Sept. 30 a longer dispute may exacerbate
                 disruptions, affecting import and export
                 activities, container availability, and
                 overall operational efficiency. 
                 The company has said it will introduce a port
                 disruption surcharge on all cargo moving to
                 and from the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast
                 terminals from Oct. 21 ranging from $1,500 to
                 $3,780 a container.     
 C.H. Robinson   ""We have been working on contingency plans
 <CHRW.O>        with customers for months, helping them
                 import freight early and diversify freight to
                 other ports,"" Mia Ginter, director of North
                 American shipping, told Reuters. A
                 significant volume shift to the West Coast
                 could challenge rail services, requiring more
                 use of truck and transload services, Ginter
                 added. 
 Maher           Maher and Maersk's APM, which are members of
 Terminals and   the employer negotiating group (USMX), said
 APM Terminals   they were keeping their terminals at the Port
                 of New York and New Jersey open for two
                 additional hours to clear cargo before the
                 potential strike.
 Garden City     The Garden City Terminal at the Port of
 Terminal and    Savannah and the Norfolk International
 Norfolk         Terminal at the Port of Virginia have also
 International   extended their gate hours for the weekend
 Terminal        before Sept. 30 to clear cargo.
 Hapag-Lloyd     The shipping giant has said it is closely
 <HLAG.DE>       monitoring the strike situation and will keep
                 customers involved as developments unfold.
 Andreas Stihl   The German chainsaw manufacturer Andreas
 AG & Co         Stihl AG & Co told Reuters it is also
                 developing contingency plans to keep exports
                 flowing from its factory near the Port of
                 Virginia, but didn't elaborate. Stihl's U.S.
                 plant ships products to over 80 countries.
 Designer        Ronnie Robinson, chief supply chain officer
 Brands <DBI.N>  at DSW parent company Designer Brands, said
                 the company has shifted half of its usual
                 imports through the East Coast to the West
                 Coast. Robinson added that his company cannot
                 risk late deliveries to clients like Macy's
                 <M.N>, Nordstrom <JWN.N>, and Dillard's
                 <DDS.N> department stores, even if it means
                 paying more for shipments. 
 National        NAM CEO Jay Timmons said a strike would throw
 Association of  manufacturing supply chains throughout the
 Manufacturers   U.S. into disarray. ""Billions of dollars of
                 goods - from food to vehicles to electronics
                 - rely on access to the East and Gulf Coast
                 ports,"" Timmons said on Monday. 
 Inter IKEA,     ""We are closely monitoring the situation and
 which makes     hope for an agreement between the parties as
 IKEA furniture  soon as possible. It is too early to comment
                 on any possible constraints the strike might
                 have on our supply chain.""
 McCormick &     The company said it co-ordinated mitigation
 Company         plans with domestic suppliers with inbound
 <MKC.N>         supply coming from outside U.S.
 National        The retailer group urges U.S. President Joe
 Retail          Biden to use all available authority, tools
 Federation      including Taft-Hartley act, to immediately
                 restore operations at all impacted container
                 ports, get the parties back to the
                 negotiating table and ensure there are no
                 further disruptions
 BNSF Railway    The railroad said it was carefully monitoring
                 the situation with the East and Gulf Coast
                 ports and was fully prepared for any shifts
                 in demand for rail service, adding that its
                 local teams continue to work with its
                 terminal operators on the specific needs to
                 meet the demands of their facilities.
 Walmart         The retailer said it has prepared for
 <WMT.N>         unforeseen disruptions in its supply chain
                 and maintains additional sources of supply to
                 ensure it has key products available for its
                 customers when and how they want them.
 U.S.            The department said it does not expect
 Department of   shortages anytime in the near future for most
 Agriculture     items and adds it is keeping an eye on
                 downstream impacts in west, and will continue
                 to monitor and work with industry to respond
                 to potential impacts. 
 Merit Medical   The medical device maker's CEO Fred
 Systems         Lampropoulos said the company anticipated the
 <MMSI.O>        strike and switched a portion of its shipment
                 to air transport before July.
 CSX <CSX.O>     The railroad said it has been flexible,
                 adding service in collaboration with western
                 partners to provide customers with
                 alternative options to West Coast ports.
 Ahold Delhaize  The owner of the Food Lion and Hannaford
 <AD.AS>         grocery chains said it has been preparing for
                 the situation and remains in close dialogue
                 with suppliers, including local ones, to
                 ensure stores are stocked. It expects minimal
                 impact on its supply chain for now.

2024,CHRW.OQ,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20241001:nL1N3LD0OW:7,2024-10-01 15:22:57.000,FACTBOX-Companies have planned for US East Coast ports strike,"(Adds McCormick, National Retail Federation, BNSF Railway,
Walmart, US Department of Agriculture, Merit Medical Systems,
CSX)
       Oct 1 (Reuters) - Some 45,000 union workers walked off
the job at seaports on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts on Oct. 1,
cutting off vital trade arteries just weeks ahead of the
nation's presidential election.
    The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) union,
which represents dockworkers across 36 ports on the U.S. East
Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, remains deadlocked with the United
States Maritime Alliance (USMX) employer group on wage issues.
    The stoppage is the first coast-wide ILA strike since 1977
and halts the flow of about half the nation's ocean shipping. A
two-week strike could mean that ports would not return to normal
operations until 2025, according to Sea-Intelligence, a
Copenhagen-based shipping advisory firm.
    Here is what global companies and stakeholders have said
regarding a potential strike:
     
 Costco          U.S. retailer Costco's contingency plans
 Wholesale       include pre-shipping some products to get in
 <COST.O>        holiday goods early and preparing to use
                 different ports, Costco's CEO Ron Vachris said
                 last week.
 Maersk          The Danish shipping and logistics giant said on
 <MAERSKb.CO>    Sept. 30 a longer dispute may exacerbate
                 disruptions, affecting import and export
                 activities, container availability, and overall
                 operational efficiency. 
                 The company has said it will introduce a port
                 disruption surcharge on all cargo moving to and
                 from the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast
                 terminals from Oct. 21 ranging from $1,500 to
                 $3,780 a container.     
 C.H. Robinson   ""We have been working on contingency plans with
 <CHRW.O>        customers for months, helping them import
                 freight early and diversify freight to other
                 ports,"" Mia Ginter, director of North American
                 shipping, told Reuters. A significant volume
                 shift to the West Coast could challenge rail
                 services, requiring more use of truck and
                 transload services, Ginter added. 
 Maher           Maher and Maersk's APM, which are members of
 Terminals and   the employer negotiating group (USMX), said
 APM Terminals   they were keeping their terminals at the Port
                 of New York and New Jersey open for two
                 additional hours to clear cargo before the
                 potential strike.
 Garden City     The Garden City Terminal at the Port of
 Terminal and    Savannah and the Norfolk International Terminal
 Norfolk         at the Port of Virginia have also extended
 International   their gate hours for the weekend before Sept.
 Terminal        30 to clear cargo.
 Hapag-Lloyd     The shipping giant has said it is closely
 <HLAG.DE>       monitoring the strike situation and will keep
                 customers involved as developments unfold.
 Andreas Stihl   The German chainsaw manufacturer Andreas Stihl
 AG & Co         AG & Co told Reuters it is also developing
                 contingency plans to keep exports flowing from
                 its factory near the Port of Virginia, but
                 didn't elaborate. Stihl's U.S. plant ships
                 products to over 80 countries.
 Designer        Ronnie Robinson, chief supply chain officer at
 Brands <DBI.N>  DSW parent company Designer Brands, said the
                 company has shifted half of its usual imports
                 through the East Coast to the West Coast.
                 Robinson added that his company cannot risk
                 late deliveries to clients like Macy's <M.N>,
                 Nordstrom <JWN.N>, and Dillard's <DDS.N>
                 department stores, even if it means paying more
                 for shipments. 
 National        NAM CEO Jay Timmons said a strike would throw
 Association of  manufacturing supply chains throughout the U.S.
 Manufacturers   into disarray. ""Billions of dollars of goods -
                 from food to vehicles to electronics - rely on
                 access to the East and Gulf Coast ports,""
                 Timmons said on Monday. 
 Inter IKEA,     ""We are closely monitoring the situation and
 which makes     hope for an agreement between the parties as
 IKEA furniture  soon as possible. It is too early to comment on
                 any possible constraints the strike might have
                 on our supply chain.""
                             The company said it co-ordinated
 McCormick &     mitigation plans with domestic suppliers with
 Company         inbound supply coming from outside U.S.
 <MKC.N>         
 National                    The retailer group urges U.S.
 Retail          President Joe Biden to use all available
 Federation      authority, tools including Taft-Hartley act, to
                 immediately restore operations at all impacted
                 container ports, get the parties back to the
                 negotiating table and ensure there are no
                 further disruptions
                 
 BNSF Railway                The railroad said it was carefully
                 monitoring the situation with the East and Gulf
                 Coast ports and was fully prepared for any
                 shifts in demand for rail service, adding that
                 its local teams continue to work with its
                 terminal operators on the specific needs to
                 meet the demands of their facilities.

       Oct 1 (Reuters) - Some 45,000 union workers walked off the job at seaports on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts on Oct. 1, cutting off vital trade arteries just weeks ahead of the nation's presidential election.
    The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) union, which represents dockworkers across 36 ports on the U.S. East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, remains deadlocked with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) employer group on wage issues.
    The stoppage is the first coast-wide ILA strike since 1977 and halts the flow of about half the nation's ocean shipping. A two-week strike could mean that ports would not return to normal operations until 2025, according to Sea-Intelligence, a Copenhagen-based shipping advisory firm.
    Here is what global companies and stakeholders have said regarding a potential strike:
     
 Costco     U.S. retailer Costco's contingency plans
 Wholesale  include pre-shipping some products to get in
 <COST.O>   holiday goods early and preparing to use
            different ports, Costco's CEO Ron Vachris said
            last week.
 Maersk     The Danish shipping and logistics giant said on
 <MAERSKb.  Sept. 30 a longer dispute may exacerbate
 CO>        disruptions, affecting import and export
            activities, container availability, and overall
            operational efficiency. 
            The company has said it will introduce a port
            disruption surcharge on all cargo moving to and
            from the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast
            terminals from Oct. 21 ranging from $1,500 to
            $3,780 a container.     
 C.H.       ""We have been working on contingency plans with
 Robinson   customers for months, helping them import
 <CHRW.O>   freight early and diversify freight to other
            ports,"" Mia Ginter, director of North American
            shipping, told Reuters. A significant volume
            shift to the West Coast could challenge rail
            services, requiring more use of truck and
            transload services, Ginter added. 
 Maher      Maher and Maersk's APM, which are members of
 Terminals  the employer negotiating group (USMX), said
 and APM    they were keeping their terminals at the Port
 Terminals  of New York and New Jersey open for two
            additional hours to clear cargo before the
            potential strike.
 Garden     The Garden City Terminal at the Port of
 City       Savannah and the Norfolk International Terminal
 Terminal   at the Port of Virginia have also extended
 and        their gate hours for the weekend before Sept.
 Norfolk    30 to clear cargo.

 Hapag-Llo  The shipping giant has said it is closely

 <HLAG.DE>  customers involved as developments unfold.
 Andreas    The German chainsaw manufacturer Andreas Stihl
 Stihl AG   AG & Co told Reuters it is also developing
 & Co       contingency plans to keep exports flowing from
            its factory near the Port of Virginia, but
            didn't elaborate. Stihl's U.S. plant ships
            products to over 80 countries.
 Designer   Ronnie Robinson, chief supply chain officer at
 Brands     DSW parent company Designer Brands, said the
 <DBI.N>    company has shifted half of its usual imports
            through the East Coast to the West Coast.
            Robinson added that his company cannot risk
            late deliveries to clients like Macy's <M.N>,
            Nordstrom <JWN.N>, and Dillard's <DDS.N>
            department stores, even if it means paying more
            for shipments. 
 National   NAM CEO Jay Timmons said a strike would throw
 Associati  manufacturing supply chains throughout the U.S.
 on of      into disarray. ""Billions of dollars of goods -
 Manufactu  from food to vehicles to electronics - rely on

       Aug 22 (Reuters) - Canada's freight rail transport could
come to a grinding halt after the country's two biggest railroad
operators announced an unprecedented, simultaneous work stoppage
following deadlocked talks over labor contracts.
    Canadian National Railway <CNR.TO> and Canadian Pacific
Kansas City <CP.TO> said they had locked out their workers and
shut their networks in the country early on Thursday after
last-minute talks with the Teamsters union failed to avert a
costly stoppage.
    Canada, the world's second-largest country by area, relies
heavily on railways to transport grain, automobiles, potash,
coal and other goods. The railways transport about C$380 billion
($277 billion) worth of goods and commodities annually, and the
impact of the rail stoppage is expected to be felt across North
America.
    Rating agency Moody's estimates the simultaneous stoppage
could cost the Canadian economy C$341 million per day. 
    Here are some sectors set to be damaged by the rail
stoppage:
    
FERTILIZERS
* Fertilizers account for the third-highest volume among
commodities shipped by Canadian railways, and 75% of all
fertilizer produced and used in the country is moved by rail. 
* The railways move an average of 69,000 metric tons of
fertilizer product per day, equivalent to four to five trains
daily.
* Fertilizer Canada, which represents producers such as CF
Industries <CF.N> and Nutrien <NTR.TO>, has estimated C$55
million to C$63 million per day in lost sales revenue from
disruptions of all rail services.
* Top potash producer Nutrien said the stoppage could hamper its
full-year potash sales.
    
TRUCKING 
* About 85% of U.S.-Canada cross-border freight in either
direction is primarily handled by Canadian trucking carriers.
* Truckers say they can absorb some of the increased demand, but
cannot replace long-haul rail distribution, especially for bulk
commodities such as coal, potash and food grains.
* Truckload shippers with spot freight, as well as rail shippers
looking to convert to truck, should expect not only higher costs
but also longer lead times, says U.S. freight forwarder C.H.
Robinson <CHRW.O>.
    
COAL
* Coal is one of Canada's top bulk commodities transported by
rail, with more than 30 million metric tons moved annually,
according to the Coal Association of Canada.
* Shipment disruptions could affect mining giant Glencore
<GLEN.L> and its majority-owned unit, Elk Valley Resources.     
 
CRUDE OIL
* An average of 94,400 barrels per day of crude oil has been
exported via rails this year, according to the Canada Energy
Regulator.
* The strike is, however, unlikely to significantly reduce oil
exports to the United States, due to excess capacity on Trans
Mountain and other pipelines.
            
GRAINS AND AGRI PRODUCTS
* Canadian farmers rely on the railways to move their products
to the market. As much as 94% of grain is shipped by rail,
according to Grain Growers of Canada.
* A stoppage would crimp shipments of U.S. spring wheat from
Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota to the Pacific
Northwest for export. 
* Nearly three dozen North American agriculture groups have
warned a simultaneous stoppage would be particularly severe on
bulk commodity exporters in both Canada and the United States.
           
TIMBER 
* With exports worth C$45.5 billion in 2022, as per Canadian
government data, the forest sector is an important contributor
to the country's economy. 
* Pulp producer Mercer International <MERC.O> said it was
working on contingency plans including alternative transport
methods in anticipation of the rail stoppage, while Conifex
Timber <CFF.TO> is reducing its sawmill operating schedule at
its Mackenzie, British Columbia site 
* Canadian National Railway is North America's largest rail
carrier of forest products, according to its website. 
   
   
AUTOS
* The U.S. imported and exported transportation equipment worth
about $73 billion respectively in 2023 from Canada, according to
the International Trade Administration.
* Canadian National's website said it handles over 2 million
finished vehicles on an annual basis, catering to more than 12
North American vehicle assembly plants.
* Canadian Pacific Kansas City caters to about 90% of automotive
assembly plants in Mexico, it said on its website.
    
WINE INDUSTRY
* Canada exported 219.78 kilolitres of wine in 2023 and imported
407.38 kilolitres, per government data.
* Ontario Craft Wineries, a local trade association, said a rail
stoppage could apply supply chain pressure on several inputs
such as glass bottles, corks, and barrels and affect its
members' ability to export wines to other countries or slow down
the rate of imported bulk wine into Canada.

    By Anna Mehler Paperny and Nivedita Balu
       TORONTO, Aug 20 (Reuters) - As Canada braced for a
freight rail stoppage that could hit industries ranging from
autos to agriculture, the trucking sector said it faced higher
demand it could not meet.
Unless labor agreements are reached, Canadian National Railway
<CNR.TO> and Canadian Pacific Kansas City <CP.TO> - which hold a
duopoly - plan to indefinitely halt operations on Thursday at
the same time, marking a first.
Canada relies heavily on railways to transport goods and
commodities, but trains are already winding down in anticipation
of a strike or lockout.
Daman Grewal, a senior operations manager with British
Columbia-based Centurion Trucking, would normally expect 20 or
30 online postings from shippers seeking trips east across
Canada on an August Monday. On Monday morning, he saw more than
500.
""Last week is when a lot of the panic started to set in,"" said
Grewal, noting trips for which he charged C$7,000 ($5,139) a few
days ago now cost up to C$9,000. ""Similar to COVID, you see the
scarcity in supply chain.""
Grewal said Centurion could increase capacity 10% to 20%,
largely by reducing driver downtime.
""We would just have to turn the drivers around a little bit
quicker,"" he said. 
    Industry officials said some softening in the economy has
left room to increase capacity but not enough to make up for
idled railways.
Some rail shippers have been trying to book additional truck
capacity since February ahead of a disruption, said Alberta
Motor Transport Association president Robert Harper. 
    ""The industry can help out in the short term in reallocating
assets, but in the long term you simply cannot replace long-haul
rail distribution. Because in some cases, the industry doesn't
have the equipment nor the capacity,"" Harper said.
     
    NO PLAN B
    U.S. freight forwarder C.H. Robinson <CHRW.O> estimates 85%
of U.S.-Canada cross-border road freight in either direction is
handled by Canadian trucking carriers.
    ""Anytime you have an event that causes a surge in trucking
demand and sudden tightening of capacity, costs in the spot
market can increase dramatically. In the past, we've seen rates
in Canada double overnight,"" said C.H. Robinson's vice president
for Canada Scott Shannon, adding this will result in not just
higher costs, but also longer lead times.    
CN and CPKC have begun phased shutdowns of their networks ahead
of the looming stoppage. 
    The severity of the disruption, should it occur, will be a
factor of how long it lasts, said Joseph Towers, a senior rail
analyst at FTR Transportation Intelligence.
    Canada's federal government may have no choice but to step
in to end a stoppage that could cripple industries, said Western
University supply chain expert Fraser Johnson.
    ""There is no Plan B for any of these industries because it's
not practical to substitute trucks for established supply chains
that use rail. ... You can't snap your fingers and increase your
capacity in terms of trucking.""

       Aug 19 (Reuters) - U.S. freight forwarder C.H. Robinson
<CHRW.O> said on Monday it was diverting some of its U.S.
customers' ocean cargo away from Canadian ports as the threat of
a rail strike looms.
    It said roughly 80% of its customers who had switched are
now exporting through Los Angeles/Long Beach ports and the rest
through Seattle/Tacoma ports.
    Canadian railroads, Canadian National <CNR.TO> and Canadian
Pacific Kansas City <CP.TO>, are bracing for a possible work
stoppage by the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference Union.
    ""Now that a strike notice has been declared, some of our
Canadian export customers are starting to ship time-sensitive
goods to the ports by truck to avoid containers being stuck at
rail terminals during a strike,"" C.H. Robinson's Canada VP Scott
Shannon said in a statement to Reuters.
    C.H. Robinson is lining up extra trucking capacity on both
sides of the border, as volumes are expected to shift to
highways following the disruption.
    A strike, which could come as early as August 22, brings a
level of uncertainty for shippers in both U.S. and Canada,
forcing them to think about over-the-road options.

    By David Ljunggren and Promit Mukherjee
       OTTAWA, Aug 14 (Reuters) - North American industry
groups and shippers are bracing for an unprecedented
simultaneous stoppage at both of Canada's main railway companies
that could inflict billions of dollars' worth of economic
damage.
    Canada is the world's second-largest country by area and
relies heavily on trains to transport grain, beans, automobiles,
potash, coal and other goods.
    ""It's a catastrophe. Literally nothing would move,"" said
Greg Northey, vice president of public affairs at Pulse Canada.
    Talks between Canadian National Railway <CNR.TO> and
Canadian Pacific Kansas City <CP.TO> on one hand and the
Teamsters union on the other have deadlocked, with each side
accusing the other of bad faith.
    The rail companies say they will start locking out workers
on Aug. 22  if they cannot reach a labor deal, while the union
says it is ready to call a strike for that date.
    Industry groups want the Liberal government of Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau to prevent a stoppage, noting Canada's
railways transport around C$380 billion ($277 billion) worth of
goods annually.
    ""Factoring in the millions of Canadian jobs that would be
impacted, the magnitude of the disruption is daunting,"" the
Business Council of Canada lobby organization said in an open
letter to Trudeau and Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon.
    
    U.S. FREIGHT TRAFFIC IMPACTED
    A stoppage would also hit the United States, given the
degree of integration between the two economies. Canada sends
around 75% of all goods exports south of the border. 
    The networks of the two Canadian rail operators, CN and
CPKC, connect with several key U.S. rail and shipping hubs such
as Chicago, New Orleans, Minneapolis and Memphis. CPKC's network
also extends further south connecting with ports on both the
east and west coast of Mexico.
    CN said on Tuesday it was putting in place an embargo on any
new reservations for movement of hazardous materials,
security-sensitive cargoes or refrigerated containers
originating in Canada, starting on Thursday.    
    It also announced it was embargoing all intermodal traffic
originating from over half a dozen U.S. hubs with which its
network connects, starting on Friday. 
    Separately, U.S. rail operator Norfolk Southern <NSC.N> on
Tuesday advised customers that it was embargoing all hazardous
and security-sensitive cargoes to or from CN and CPKC's networks
effective immediately. It said additional embargoes may come in
case of any work stoppages at the Canadian rail operators.
    Some U.S. companies find it more efficient to use Montreal
or Vancouver for imports and exports.
        U.S. logistics firm C.H. Robinson <CHRW.O>, which
manages more than 650,000 loads across the border a year, said
it was lining up extra trucking capacity on both sides of the
border. 
  
        ""When all trains serving the entire country could
literally be stopped on their tracks, that's another whole level
of disruption,"" said Scott Shannon, a senior executive at C.H.
Robinson.
  
        
  
        PRESSURE MOUNTS
  
        Industry groups say MacKinnon has the power to refer the
dispute to the country's labor relations board and thereby head
off a stoppage.
  
        MacKinnon has so far said he wants the two sides to
strike a deal at the negotiating table.
  
        Pressure on Ottawa looks set to mount in the coming days
as industry groups hammer home the potential costs of a
stoppage.
  
        Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley in a note to clients
said that each week of shipment disruptions could dent the
earnings before taxes of mining giant Glencore <GLEN.L> by an
estimated $100 million, or more, as a rail shutdown would
disrupt coal shipments from its majority-owned unit, Elk Valley
Resources.  
  
        The Chemistry Industry Association of Canada said
chlorine shipments would soon become unavailable, hitting the
quality of drinking water within two weeks.
  
        ""There are very large municipalities that - if the
strike goes on - are going to be under boil water advisories,""
CEO Bob Masterson said by phone, noting that the industry moved
more than 500 rail cars a day.
  
        ""There is no plan B ... to transport this kind of volume
you will need 2,000 trucks, roughly. There aren't 2,000 trucks,
and there aren't 2,000 drivers,"" he said.

       OTTAWA, Aug 14 (Reuters) - North American industry

simultaneous stoppage at both of Canada's main railway companies
that could inflict billions of dollars' worth of economic
damage.
    Canada is the world's second-largest country by area and

dried seeds of legume plants, potash, coal, automobiles and
other goods.

Street estimates for second-quarter profit on Wednesday, helped
by the logistics firm's efforts to rein in costs, sending its
shares up nearly 8% in aftermarket trade.
    North America freight companies have shifted their focus to
beefing up margins as volumes remain low amid a long-drawn slump
in demand. 
    C.H. Robinson's operating expenses reduced 4.4%, while
average employee headcount fell by 10% in the second quarter.
    ""Although we continue to fight through an elongated freight
recession, we are winning and executing better at this point in
the cycle,""  CEO Dave Bozeman said in a statement.
    The Minnesota-based company posted an adjusted income of
$1.15 per share for its quarter ended June 30, compared with
analysts' average expectations of 96 cents, according to LSEG
data.
    Total revenue rose 1.4% to $4.5 billion, driven by higher
pricing in its ocean services business.

has agreed to buy the European logistics operations of its U.S.
rival C.H. Robinson <CHRW.O> in a deal set to double its revenue
to 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion), the German company said on
Tuesday.
    Sennder, which brokers freight loads to freight forwarders
via its online platform, hopes to optimise its connecting
journeys with the larger size. ""This makes us more attractive
for small transport companies as well as shippers across
Europe,"" Sennder's Chief Executive David Nothacker said.
    The firm, which according to its website is backed by
private equity investors Baillie Gifford, Accel and HV Capital,
has operations across Europe, including in the Netherlands,
France and Poland. 
    The acquisition of C.H. Robinson's European Surface
Transportation (EST) operations was expected to close in the
final quarter of this year, Sennder said in a statement.
    ""The transaction will be settled entirely in cash. We have
agreed not to disclose the purchase price,"" Nothacker told
Reuters. Sennder would continue to examine new opportunities in
the coming months, he added. ""We want to continue to invest, we
want to continue to grow, we have big plans.""
    The company does not currently plan a new financing round,
Nothacker said. About a year ago, the company had raised more
than $350 million.

    KLAVENESS COMBINATION CARRIERS <KCCK.OL> 
    The Norway-based fleet operator said on Jan. 16 it would not
 trade any of its vessels through the Red Sea until the

    KUEHNE + NAGEL <KNIN.S>

million Swiss francs range.
    
    MAERSK <MAERSKb.CO>
    The Danish shipping group on Jan. 5 suspended Red Sea
traffic ""for the foreseeable future"". Maersk said on May 6 that

<CHRW.O> reported first-quarter revenue above Wall Street
estimates on Wednesday, helped by higher pricing and increased
volume in its ocean services and truckload units.
    Revenue from its global forwarding unit, which deals with
ocean and air freight, rose 8.7% to $858.6 million, compared
with $790 million a year ago.
    The company's total revenue decreased 4.3% to $4.41 billion,
but beat analysts' estimate of $4.27 billion, according to LSEG
data.
    ""Although we continue to battle through an elongated freight
recession with an oversupply of capacity, I'm optimistic about
our ability to continue improving our execution regardless of
the market environment,"" CEO Dave Bozeman said. 
     A rise in shipments during the pandemic saw a surge in new
freight brokers entering the industry but, as overall volumes
drop, the competition to win more freight increases.
    This excess capacity in a low volume environment forces
brokers to bid on lower prices for shipments, impacting their
margins and causing freight rates to drop across the industry.
    The company's North American surface transportation (NAST)
unit, its biggest segment, which includes truckload and less
than truckload (LTL) transportation brokerage services, posted a
revenue of $3 billion, down 9.2% from $3.30 billion a year
earlier.
    The Minnesota-based company posted net income of $92.9
million, or 78 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31,
compared with $114.9 million, or 96 cents per share, a year
earlier.
    Shares of the company rose 13.5% to $81.9 in extended

       Feb 14(Reuters) - Houthi militants in Yemen have stepped
up attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, impacting a shipping route
vital to east-west trade.
    In response, some shipping companies have instructed vessels
to instead sail around southern Africa, a longer and therefore
more expensive route.
    Below are actions taken by companies (in alphabetical
order):

    C.H. ROBINSON <CHRW.O>
    The global logistics group said on Dec. 22 it had rerouted
more than 25 vessels around Africa over the previous week, and
that number was likely to grow.
    ""Blank sailings and rate increases are expected to continue
across many trades into Q1 of 2024,"" it said.

    CMA CGM
    On Feb 2, the French shipping group suspended until further
notice all crossings by its vessels of the Bab al-Mandab Strait
in and out of the Red Sea,  a source familiar with the matter
said.
    It had previously said it would reroute a weekly service
between Europe and Australia to avoid attacks, and that it
expected months of disruption.
    
    EURONAV <EUAV.BR> 
    The Belgian oil tanker firm said on Dec. 18 it would avoid
the Red Sea until further notice.

    EVERGREEN <2603.TW> 
    The Taiwanese container shipping line said on Dec. 18 its
vessels on regional services to Red Sea ports would sail to safe
waters nearby, while ships scheduled to pass through the Red Sea
would be rerouted around Africa. It also temporarily stopped
accepting Israeli cargo.

    The Norway-based oil tanker group on Dec. 18 said its
vessels would avoid the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

    GRAM CAR CARRIERS <GCC.OL>
    The Norwegian auto carrier said on Dec. 21 its vessels were

    HAPAG-LLOYD <HLAG.DE> 
    The German container shipping line said on Jan. 22 it will
continue to route its vessels around Africa until further
notice. 
    The company also said it is introducing land corridors from
Jebel Ali, Dammam and Jubail to its ocean shuttle service out of
Jeddah to mitigate the impact on its business.
    CEO Rolf Habben Jansen warned on Jan. 31 the attacks on
cargo vessels in the Red Sea are unlikely to cease soon, adding
that a political deal and a mission to protect freight vessels
might bring a resolution within six months.
    The company swung to a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter
operating loss due to lower transport volumes following the
attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
    
    HMM <011200.KS> 
    The South Korean container shipper said on Dec. 19 it had
ordered its ships which would normally use the Suez Canal to

    MAERSK <MAERSKb.CO>
    The Danish shipping group on Jan. 5 suspended Red Sea
traffic ""for the foreseeable future"".
    On Jan. 18, Maersk said the Red Sea disruptions and winter
weather were causing congestion at container terminals, urging
customers to pick up their units as soon as possible. It also
started offering customers the option to shift some cargo from
vessels to air freight at ports in Oman and the UAE.
    A day earlier, its CEO said the Red Sea-related disruption
to global shipping would likely last at least a few months.
    On Jan. 16, Maersk sent two container ships through the Red
Sea carrying goods for the U.S. military and government. 
    On Jan. 25 it suspended Red Sea transits by vessels of 
Maersk Line, Limited (MLL), its U.S. subsidiary carrying cargo
for U.S. government agencies.
    On Feb. 8, Maersk warned that container shipping
overcapacity would hit profits more than expected this year, and
that it did not see a major boost from the jump in freight rates
due to disruptions.

       Feb 2(Reuters) - Houthi militants in Yemen have stepped
up attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, impacting a shipping route
vital to east-west trade.
    In response, some shipping companies have instructed vessels
to instead sail around southern Africa, a longer and therefore
more expensive route.
    Below are actions taken by companies (in alphabetical
order):

    C.H. ROBINSON <CHRW.O>
    The global logistics group said on Dec. 22 it had rerouted
more than 25 vessels around Africa over the previous week, and
that number was likely to grow.
    ""Blank sailings and rate increases are expected to continue
across many trades into Q1 of 2024,"" it said.

    CMA CGM
    On Feb 2, the French shipping group suspended until further
notice all crossings by its vessels of the Bab al-Mandab Strait
in and out of the Red Sea.
    It had previously said it would reroute a weekly service
between Europe and Australia to avoid attacks, and that it
expected months of disruption.
    
    EURONAV <EUAV.BR> 
    The Belgian oil tanker firm said on Dec. 18 it would avoid
the Red Sea until further notice.

    EVERGREEN <2603.TW> 
    The Taiwanese container shipping line said on Dec. 18 its
vessels on regional services to Red Sea ports would sail to safe
waters nearby, while ships scheduled to pass through the Red Sea
would be rerouted around Africa. It also temporarily stopped
accepting Israeli cargo.

    FRONTLINE <FRO.OL> 
    The Norway-based oil tanker group on Dec. 18 said its
vessels would avoid the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

    GRAM CAR CARRIERS <GCC.OL>
    The Norwegian auto carrier said on Dec. 21 its vessels were
restricted from passing through the Red Sea.

    HAFNIA <HAFNI.OL>
    The Norwegian shipping firm said on Jan. 12 it has halted
all ships heading towards or within the Bab al-Mandab Strait.

    HAPAG-LLOYD <HLAG.DE> 
    The German container shipping line said on Jan. 22 it will
continue to route its vessels around Africa until further
notice. 
    The company also said it is introducing land corridors from
Jebel Ali, Dammam and Jubail to its ocean shuttle service out of
Jeddah to mitigate the impact on its business.
    CEO Rolf Habben Jansen warned on Jan. 31 the attacks on
cargo vessels in the Red Sea are unlikely to cease soon, adding
that a political deal and a mission to protect freight vessels
might bring a resolution within six months.
    The company swung to a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter
operating loss due to lower transport volumes following the
attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
    
    HMM <011200.KS> 
    The South Korean container shipper said on Dec. 19 it had
ordered its ships which would normally use the Suez Canal to
reroute around Africa.

    HOEGH AUTOLINERS <HAUTO.OL>
    The Norwegian auto carrier said on Dec. 20 it would stop
sailing via the Red Sea.

    KLAVENESS COMBINATION CARRIERS <KCCK.OL> 
    The Norway-based fleet operator said on Jan. 16 it would not
 trade any of its vessels through the Red Sea until the
situation improves.

    KUEHNE + NAGEL <KNIN.S> 
    ""Even if from today forward the Bab al-Mandab Strait was to
become safe and secure for transit, we expect it will take a
minimum of two months before vessels could assume normal
rotational patterns,"" Michael Aldwell, executive VP for sea
logistics at the Swiss logistics firm, said on Jan. 12.

    MAERSK <MAERSKb.CO>
    The Danish shipping group on Jan. 5 suspended Red Sea
traffic ""for the foreseeable future"".
    On Jan. 18, Maersk said the Red Sea disruptions and winter
weather were causing congestion at container terminals, urging
customers to pick up their units as soon as possible. It also
started offering customers the option to shift some cargo from
vessels to air freight at ports in Oman and the UAE.
    A day earlier, its CEO said the Red Sea-related disruption
to global shipping would likely last at least a few months.
    On Jan. 16, Maersk sent two container ships through the Red
Sea carrying goods for the U.S. military and government. 
    On Jan. 25 it suspended Red Sea transits by vessels of 
Maersk Line, Limited (MLL), its U.S. subsidiary carrying cargo
for U.S. government agencies.

    MSC
    Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) said on Dec. 16 its
ships would not transit through the Suez Canal.

    NIPPON YUSEN <9101.T> 
    Japan's biggest shipper by sales suspended navigation
through the Red Sea for all vessels it operates, a spokesperson
told Reuters on Jan. 16. It has also instructed vessels near the
Red Sea to wait in safe waters and is considering route change.

    OCEAN NETWORK EXPRESS
    Ocean Network Express, a joint venture between Japan's
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha <9107.T>, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines <9104.T> and
Nippon Yusen, said on Dec. 19 it would reroute vessels from the
Red Sea to the Cape of Good Hope or temporarily pause journeys
and move to safe areas.

    OOCL
    The Hong Kong-headquartered container group said on Dec. 21
it had instructed its vessels to either divert their route away
from the Red Sea or suspend sailing. It also stopped accepting
cargo to and from Israel until further notice.

    TAILWIND SHIPPING LINES
    Lidl unit, which transports non-food goods for the discount
supermarket chain and goods for third-party customers, said it
was sailing around Africa for now.
    
    TORM <TRMDa.CO>
    The Danish oil tanker group said on Jan. 12 it had decided
to pause all transits through the southern Red Sea for now.
  
    WALLENIUS WILHELMSEN <WAWI.OL> 
    The Norwegian shipping group said on Dec. 19 it would halt
Red Sea transits until further notice.

    YANG MING MARINE TRANSPORT <2609.TW> 
    The Taiwanese container shipping company said on Dec. 18 it
would divert ships sailing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden via the Cape of Good Hope for the next two weeks.

paragraphs 8-9)
    By Chibuike Oguh
       NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - C.H. Robinson Worldwide's
<CHRW.O> stock tumbled nearly 15% on Thursday after weak freight
demand combined with disruptions arising from the Red Sea crisis
caused the U.S. freight and logistics giant's fourth quarter
results to miss analyst estimates.
    C.H. Robinson's revenue fell about 17% to $4.2 billion in
the quarter ended Dec. 31, while adjusted earnings per share
fell 51% to 50 cents, dragged down by poor demand and falling
prices from excess freight capacity, the company reported late
on Wednesday. 
   Wall Street analysts had expected revenue of $4.34 billion
and earnings per share of 81 cents, according to LSEG data.
   C.H. Robinson shares dropped to as low as $71.57, the lowest
since May 2020, and were on track for their biggest daily
percent decline since October 2019. The stock has pared some
losses and was down 12.8% at $73.2 in afternoon trading.
    ""Our fourth quarter results did not meet our expectations as
we continue to battle through a poor demand and pricing
environment,"" C.H. Robinson Chief Executive Dave Bozeman said
during an analyst conference call on Wednesday.
    Attacks by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group on vessels in
the Red Sea, launched to express solidarity with Palestinians in
Gaza, have forced shippers like C.H. Robinson to take longer
routes that can add weeks to delivery times.
    ""While the Red Sea disruption continues without any clear
timeline of when it will be resolved, the strain on capacity and
the elevated spot rates are expected to continue through at
least the Chinese New Year,"" Bozeman said. The Lunar New Year
begins on Feb. 10.
    C.H. Robinson's management doesn't believe Red Sea
disruptions will have a lasting impact as ocean capacity will
come online and offset the current pressure on rates, JPMorgan
analysts led Brian Ossenbeck said in an investor note, which has
an ""underweight"" rating on the stock.
    The median price target of the 25 analysts covering C.H.
Robinson' stock is $80.50, down from $85 in January, and their
average recommendation is ""hold,"" according to LSEG data.

       NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Shares of C.H. Robinson
Worldwide <CHRW.O> stock tumbled by 14% on Thursday after weak
freight demand combined with disruptions arising from the Red
Sea crisis caused the U.S. freight and logistics giant's fourth
quarter results to miss analyst estimates.
    C.H. Robinson's revenue fell about 17% to $4.2 billion in
the quarter ended Dec. 31, while adjusted earnings per share
fell 51% to 50 cents dragged down by poor demand and falling
prices from excess freight capacity, the company reported late
on Wednesday. 
   Wall Street analysts had expected revenue of $4.34 billion
and earnings per share of 81 cents, according to LSEG data.
   C.H. Robinson shares dropped to as low as $72.29, the lowest
since May 2020, and were on track for their biggest daily
percent decline since October 2019.
    ""Our fourth quarter results did not meet our expectations as
we continue to battle through a poor demand and pricing
environment,"" said C.H. Robinson Chief Executive Dave Bozeman
during an analyst conference call on Wednesday.
    Attacks by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group on vessels in
the Red Sea, launched to express solidarity with Palestinians in
Gaza, have forced shippers like C.H. Robinson to take longer
routes that can add weeks to delivery times.
    ""While the Red Sea disruption continues without any clear
time line of when it will be resolved, the strain on capacity
and the elevated spot rates are expected to continue through at
least the Chinese New Year,"" Bozeman said.

       Jan 31 (Reuters) - Iranian-backed Houthi militants in
Yemen have stepped up attacks on vessels in the Red Sea,
impacting a shipping route vital to east-west trade.
    In response, some shipping companies have instructed vessels
to instead sail around southern Africa, a longer and therefore
more expensive route.
    Below are actions taken by companies (in alphabetical
order):

    C.H. ROBINSON <CHRW.O>
    The global logistics group said on Dec. 22 it had rerouted
more than 25 vessels around Africa over the previous week, and
that number was likely to grow.
    ""Blank sailings and rate increases are expected to continue
across many trades into Q1 of 2024,"" it said.

    CMA CGM
    The French shipping firm said on Jan. 19 it would reroute a
weekly service between Europe and Australia to avoid attacks in
the Red Sea, and that it expected months of disruption.
    It had previously rerouted several vessels via the Cape of
Good Hope.
    
    EURONAV <EUAV.BR> 
    The Belgian oil tanker firm said on Dec. 18 it would avoid
the Red Sea until further notice.

    EVERGREEN <2603.TW> 
    The Taiwanese container shipping line said on Dec. 18 its
vessels on regional services to Red Sea ports would sail to safe
waters nearby, while ships scheduled to pass through the Red Sea
would be rerouted around Africa. It also temporarily stopped
accepting Israeli cargo.

    FRONTLINE <FRO.OL> 
    The Norway-based oil tanker group on Dec. 18 said its
vessels would avoid the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

    GRAM CAR CARRIERS <GCC.OL>
    The Norwegian auto carrier said on Dec. 21 its vessels were
restricted from passing through the Red Sea.

    HAFNIA <HAFNI.OL>
    The Norwegian shipping firm said on Jan. 12 it has halted
all ships heading towards or within the Bab al-Mandab Strait.

    HAPAG-LLOYD <HLAG.DE> 
    The German container shipping line said on Jan. 22 it will
continue to route its vessels around Africa until further
notice. 
    The company also said it is introducing land corridors from
Jebel Ali, Dammam and Jubail to its ocean shuttle service out of
Jeddah to mitigate the impact on its business.
    CEO Rolf Habben Jansen warned on Jan. 31 the attacks on
cargo vessels in the Red Sea are unlikely to cease soon, adding
that a political deal and a mission to protect freight vessels
might bring a resolution within six months.
        The company 
    swung
     to a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter operating loss due
to lower transport volumes following the attacks on ships in the
Red Sea.
  
    
    HMM <011200.KS> 
    The South Korean container shipper said on Dec. 19 it had
ordered its ships which would normally use the Suez Canal to
reroute around Africa.

    HOEGH AUTOLINERS <HAUTO.OL>
    The Norwegian auto carrier said on Dec. 20 it would stop
sailing via the Red Sea.

    KLAVENESS COMBINATION CARRIERS <KCCK.OL> 
    The Norway-based fleet operator said on Jan. 16 it would not
 trade any of its vessels through the Red Sea until the
situation improves.

    KUEHNE + NAGEL <KNIN.S> 
    ""Even if from today forward the Bab al-Mandab Strait was to

       Jan 25 (Reuters) - Iranian-backed Houthi militants in
Yemen have stepped up attacks on vessels in the Red Sea,
impacting a shipping route vital to East-West trade.
    In response, some shipping companies have instructed vessels
to instead sail around southern Africa, a longer and therefore
more expensive route.
    The U.S. and Britain carried out dozens of air strikes
against Houthi military targets on Jan. 11 and 12, widening
regional conflict stemming from Israel's war in Gaza.

       SEOUL, Jan 17 (Reuters) - More manufacturers are seeking
to fly their products in the next few weeks as attacks on Red
Sea shipping force them to find alternate routes, logistics
firms say, a potential boon for a sector dealing with muted
post-pandemic demand and overcapacity.     
    The Red Sea, which leads to the Suez canal, lies on the key
east-west trade route from Asia's manufacturing hubs to Europe
and onto the east coast of the Americas. About 12% of world
shipping traffic accesses the Suez Canal via its waters.
    But more than two months of attacks by Yemen's Houthi
militia on ships in the region have affected companies and
alarmed major powers in an escalation of Israel's war with
Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza.
    While air freight prices have so far remained relatively
stable as the shipping crisis coincides with a seasonal lull in
demand, data from freight booker Freightos showed rates on a 
China-to-Europe route had surged 91% week-on-week on Sunday.
    Price reporting agency TAC Index also said there were signs
of an uptick in China-to-Europe air freight rates this week.   
   
        ""We are talking to many customers already about
increased air capacity,"" said Yngve Ruud, head of Air Logistics
at global logistics firm Kühne+Nagel. ""We have probably 20-30%
more discussions and proposals than usual in January."" 
    Air freight is costly compared to sea freight, and not
competitive for bulky, low-margin items. Such constraints have
limited air cargo to less than 1% of global trade by volume,
according to airline industry association IATA.    
    But since the attacks, which have forced shippers to take
costlier routes that can add weeks to delivery times, air
freight has become a more attractive option.
    Korean Air Cargo, one of the world's largest carriers by
volume, said it was starting to see an increase in demand and
more customer inquiries.
    Several logistics firms including Germany's Schenker,
France's Bollore Logistics and US-based C.H. Robinson are also
securing additional air freight space, the companies said, and
Chrysler parent Stellantis <STLAM.MI> said last week it was
relying on air freight to cope with temporary disruptions. 
    ""As the price of ocean goes up, as the transit times
increase, and as backlogs build up, that's when shippers start
to get very concerned that they won't have their spring
inventory,"" said Neel Jones Shah, chief customer officer at
digital freight forwarder Flexport.
    ""The first thing you're going to see convert is shippers
that do 20% air 80% ocean for the same product, go to 50:50.""
   
    MULTI-MODAL OPTIONS
    A slowdown in the global economy has helped to mute the
impact on trade flows from the attacks by the Iran-aligned
Houthis, who say they are acting in solidarity with the
Palestinians in Gaza. 
    The Baltic Air Freight Index, which shows general cargo
weekly transactional rates, has fallen since early December and
was down 34% last week from a year ago. Global cargo demand was
down 2.5% in November from the same month before the pandemic,
while capacity increased 4.1%, according to IATA.
    Logistics sources say customers are increasingly looking
into multi-modal routes, shipping by sea into the Middle East,
for example, and then onwards to Europe by air.
        Kühne+Nagel said some customers have started sending
containers to Dubai and Los Angeles and then flying the goods
onwards to their destinations. 
    Asia-focused freight forwarder Dimerco also said customers
were calculating costs for sea-air combinations via Dubai as
well as direct air freight services.
    Air, however, still remains an option, rather than the
default, as customers hold off on committing amid sluggish
demand and as many factories in manufacturing hub China prepare
to close for the Lunar New Year holiday in February, Dimerco
spokesperson Alvin Fuh added.
    But the longer the Red Sea crisis continues, the more
manufacturers will turn to air freight, shippers said.
    ""The longer the situation persists, the more pressure is
added to sea freight capacity and customers' supply chains,
thereby going closer and closer to the 'tipping point' for a
need for air freight conversion,"" said Jack Liu, Senior Vice
President of Air Logistics at Kühne+Nagel Asia Pacific.

       Jan 12 (Reuters) - Iranian-backed Houthi militants in
Yemen have stepped up attacks on vessels in the Red Sea,
impacting a shipping route vital to East-West trade.
    In response, some shipping companies have instructed vessels
to instead sail around southern Africa, a slower and therefore
more expensive route.
    The U.S. and Britain launched dozens of air strikes against
Houthi military targets overnight on Jan. 11 and 12 in
retaliation for the attacks, widening regional conflict stemming
from Israel's war in Gaza.
    Below are actions taken by companies (in alphabetical
order):

    C.H. ROBINSON <CHRW.O>
    The global logistics group said on Dec. 22 it had rerouted
more than 25 vessels around the Cape of Good Hope over the past
week, and that number would likely grow.
    ""Blank sailings and rate increases are expected to continue
across many trades into Q1 of 2024,"" it added.

    CMA CGM
    The French shipping firm said on Jan. 5 it had not changed
its plans announced last month to gradually raise the number of
vessels transiting through the Suez Canal.
    It had previously rerouted several vessels via the Cape of
Good Hope.
    
    EURONAV <EUAV.BR> 
    The Belgian oil tanker firm said on Dec. 18 it would avoid
the Red Sea until further notice.

    EVERGREEN <2603.TW> 
    The Taiwanese container shipping line said on Dec. 18 its
vessels on regional services to Red Sea ports would sail to safe
waters nearby and wait for further notification, while ships
scheduled to pass through the Red Sea would be rerouted around
Africa. It also temporarily stopped accepting Israeli cargo.

    FRONTLINE <FRO.OL> 
    The Norway-based oil tanker group on Dec. 18 said its
vessels would avoid the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

    GRAM CAR CARRIERS <GCC.OL>
    The Norwegian company, which specialises in transporting
vehicles, said on Dec. 21 its vessels were restricted from
passing through the Red Sea.

    HAPAG-LLOYD <HLAG.DE> 
    The German container shipping line on Jan. 9 said it would
continue to divert its vessels away from the Suez Canal and
around the Cape of Good Hope. It will take next decisions on
Jan. 15.
    A Hapag-Lloyd spokesperson said on Jan. 12 it welcomed
measures to secure safe passage for cargo vessels, as diversions
have led to tens of millions of euros in additional monthly
costs.
    ""We are not commenting on the specific incidents that
occurred last night,"" the spokesperson said regarding the
U.S-British air strikes.

    HMM <011200.KS> 
    The South Korean container shipper said on Dec. 19 it had
ordered its ships which would normally use the Suez Canal to
reroute around Africa.

    HOEGH AUTOLINERS <HAUTO.OL>
    The Norwegian shipping company said on Dec. 20 it would stop
sailing via the Red Sea after the Norwegian Maritime Authority
raised its alert for the southern part of the sea to the highest
level.

    KLAVENESS COMBINATION CARRIERS <KCCK.OL> 
    The Norway-based fleet operator said on Dec. 28 it was
unlikely to sail any of its vessels in the Red Sea unless the
situation improves. 

    MAERSK <MAERSKb.CO>
    The Danish shipping group, which controls about one-sixth of
global container trade, said on Jan. 5 it would suspend Red Sea
traffic ""for the foreseeable future"".
    Houthi attackers had sought to board one of its container
vessels on Dec. 31.
    Following the U.S.-British strikes against Houthi military
targets, Maersk said on Jan. 12 it hopes international
interventions and a larger naval presence in the area will
eventually lead to a resumption of maritime commerce through the
strait.

    MSC
    Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) said on Dec. 16 its
ships would not transit through the Suez Canal, with some
already rerouted via the Cape of Good Hope, a day after two
ballistic missiles were fired at one of its vessels.

    OCEAN NETWORK EXPRESS
    Ocean Network Express (ONE), a joint venture between Japan's
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha <9107.T>, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines <9104.T> and
Nippon Yusen <9101.T>, said on Dec. 19 it would reroute vessels
from the Red Sea to the Cape of Good Hope or temporarily pause
journeys and move to safe areas.

    OOCL
    The Hong Kong-headquartered container group said on Dec. 21
it had instructed its vessels to either divert their route away
from the Red Sea or suspend sailing. The company, owned by
Orient Overseas (International) Ltd <0316.HK>, also stopped
accepting cargo to and from Israel until further notice.

    WALLENIUS WILHELMSEN <WAWI.OL> 
    The Norwegian shipping group said on Dec. 19 it would halt
Red Sea transits until further notice. Rerouting vessels around
Africa will add 1-2 weeks to voyage durations, it said.

    YANG MING MARINE TRANSPORT <2609.TW> 
    The Taiwanese container shipping company said on Dec. 18 it
would divert ships sailing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden via the Cape of Good Hope for the next two weeks.
