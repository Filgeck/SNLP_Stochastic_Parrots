Energy <CNP.N> on Monday reported third-quarter profit that
missed Wall Street estimates, hurt by higher maintenance costs
and lower revenue from its electric segment due to Hurricane
Beryl.
    The company said it has appointed Don Daigler to lead its
emergency preparedness and response efforts, following criticism
for its power restoration initiatives after Beryl.
    Beryl had caused significant damage to CenterPoint electric
subsidiary Houston Electric's delivery system after its landfall
in July, knocking out power for nearly 2.3 million CenterPoint
customers in Texas.
    Restaurants in and around Houston had filed a lawsuit
seeking more than $100 million from CenterPoint, alleging
incompetence and negligence in the company's efforts to restore
power.
    CenterPoint's third-quarter operations and maintenance
costs, which includes expenses related to storm restoration
efforts and grid upgrades, rose nearly 20% to $775 million.
    The company's total quarterly electric revenue declined 1.4%
to $1.24 billion, partly owing to outages related to Beryl.
    It posted an adjusted profit of 31 cents per share for the
third quarter, missing analysts' average estimates of 32 cents,
according to data compiled by LSEG.
        Houston Electric said as of Sept. 30, it estimates the
total costs of restoring the electric delivery facilities to be
about $1.1 billion, excluding carrying costs.

Dolan    
A monster Halloween week of critical market events kicked off
with a sharp slide in both crude oil prices and Japan's yen as
tensions eased somewhat in the Middle East while Japan's
election injected a rare bout of political uncertainty there.
    The yen <JPY=> took a hit first thing on Monday, slicing
through 153 per dollar to its weakest since July, as investors
figured the loss of a parliamentary majority for Japan's ruling
coalition in weekend elections would hamper moves to lift   
interest rates further.
    A period of wrangling to secure a coalition is likely after
Japan's Liberal Democratic Party and its junior partner Komeito
won 215 lower house seats to fall short of the 233 majority.
    With the Bank of Japan meeting on Wednesday, the political
consensus behind further tightening - as well as the country's
fiscal and foreign policy settings - will remain in limbo for
several weeks. LDP Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday vowed
to stay on, saying trying economic and geopolitical times call
for continuity.
    The weakening yen, however, lifted Japan's Nikkei stock
index <.N225> almost 2% and nudged the dollar up more broadly -
with the dollar index <.DXY> on course to end its best month in
more than two years.
    In another relief for inflation worriers, crude oil prices
also fell sharply on Monday, dropping more than 4% after
Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran over the weekend bypassed
Tehran's oil and nuclear facilities and did not disrupt energy
supplies - cooling tensions in the Middle East. 
    Many of the comments from both sides following the strike
appeared to step back somewhat from further escalation with new
moves for a truce in Gaza back on the table.
    U.S. crude prices <CLc1> skidded below $68 per barrel for
the first time in almost a month - and continued to track
year-on-year losses of almost 20%.
    Still, with some $139 billion of two and five-year Treasury
coupons up for auction later on Monday and next week's U.S.
election looming, Treasury yields <US10YT=RR> <US2YT=RR> climbed
first thing to their highest in almost three months.
    After a flat Friday and with Monday's economic diary thin,
U.S. stock futures were higher ahead of the bell - but traders
were bracing for a week packed with market-moving events.
    Five of the so-called Magnificent seven of U.S. megacap
stocks report earnings during the week - starting with
Alphabet's <GOOGL.O> quarterlies on Tuesday, Microsoft <MSFT.O>
and Meta <META.O> on Wednesday and Amazon <AMZN.O> and Apple
<AAPL.O> on Thursday.
    Tesla's <TSLA.O> 22% surge on its earnings last week has
whetted appetites for what may be coming down the pike.
    Alongside the BOJ decision, the health of the U.S. labor
market once again comes into view - with a stream of updates on
employment culminating in the release of the national payrolls
report on Friday.
    Thursday also brings the release of the Federal Reserve's
favored PCE inflation gauge for September - which is expected to
see the annual ""core"" PCE rate tick down a tenth to 2.6%.
    It is a big week for Britain too, with the ruling Labour
Party's first annual budget to be announced on Wednesday.
    Sterlng <GBP=> was steady ahead of the long-awaited event,
but 10-year UK government bond yields briefly touched their
highest in almost four months amid expectations of hefty
borrowing increases.
    Stocks in Europe and Asia were higher generally on Monday.
    Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks ended marginally up as
investors grew cautious ahead of key events next week, including
a legislative meeting in Beijing and the U.S. presidential
election.

    Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S.
markets later on Monday:  
* Dallas Federal Reserve October manufacturing survey
* US corporate earnings: Ford, ON Semiconductor, Regency
Centers, Waste Management, SBA Communications, F5, Welltower,
Cadence Design, Brown & Brown, Centerpoint Energy etc  
* European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos speaks in
Madrid, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem speaks in Toronto 
* US Treasury sells $69 billion of 2-year notes and $70 billion
of 5-year notes; also sells $153 billion of 3- and 6-month bills

       Sept 17 (Reuters) - Energy Transfer <ET.N> said a fire
at its natural gas liquid (NGL) pipeline in La Porte, Texas,
which started on Monday, was still burning on Tuesday and a
state regulator said it would probably keep burning into the
afternoon.
    The massive fire on Monday morning knocked out power to
thousands of homes and businesses and prompted an evacuation of
the area.
    No serious injuries were reported and the pipeline was
isolated by midday for residual product to burn off, the company
said.
    The fire occurred at a valve station on a 20-inch (50.8-cm)
pipeline used to carry NGLs, according to Energy Transfer. NGLs
can be used as inputs for petrochemical plants or burned for
space heating and cooking, among other uses.    
    ""Law enforcement agencies have initiated an investigation
into the cause of the incident,"" Energy Transfer said.
         The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC), which regulates
the state's oil and gas industry said its inspectors were on the
site of the incident and will begin their investigation once
emergency officials have deemed the scene safe.
  
        ""Energy Transfer continues to blow down the remaining
gas in the pipeline section which could last into this
afternoon,"" RRC added.
  
    Impacted land owners were being taken care of and have been
provided with lodging at area hotels, Energy Transfer said,
adding that this will continue until evacuation orders are
lifted.

 (Adds statement from City of Pasadena on reported injury in
paragraph 7)
       Sept 16 (Reuters) - A natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline
owned by Energy Transfer <ET.N> caught fire in La Porte, Texas,
on Monday morning, the company said in a statement, knocking out
power to thousands of homes and businesses and prompting a
widespread evacuation.
    Videos posted by a local news station early in the day
showed a massive flame near streets and businesses. The line had
been isolated by midday for residual product to burn off, Energy
Transfer said, adding that it did not have a timeline for how
long that process would take. 
    First responders by mid-afternoon estimated it would take a
few more hours to extinguish the fire, city officials said. The
evacuation area, which at one point had been a half-mile radius,
by then was reduced and included 941 addresses, they added. 
    The fire occurred at a valve station on a 20-inch (50.8-cm)
pipeline used to carry NGLs, according to Energy Transfer. NGLs
can be used as inputs for petrochemical plants or burned for
space heating and cooking, among other uses.
    The company also said it was aware of reports that an
unknown passenger car entered its right-of-way and struck the
valve location.
    The City of La Porte said the cause was undetermined and
under investigation. 
        A volunteer firefighter experienced heat stress and was
treated at the scene, the nearby City of Pasadena said in a
statement. Otherwise, no injuries were reported. 
  
    The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC), which regulates the
state's oil and gas industry, said it was investigating the
fire.
    It said the incident occurred in a pipeline corridor, and
that other pipeline operators in the area had been notified of
the incident and were set to ensure the safety of their systems.
    Over 5,000 CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N> customers were without
power shortly after the incident, according to a posting on the
company's website. That number fell to around 1,600 by midday. 
    ""When it is safe to do so, our electric crews will go into
the area to assess the damage to our transmission and
distribution power lines, poles and equipment and begin
restoring service to impacted customers as safely and quickly as
possible,"" the company said. 
    A nearby Walmart <WMT.N> store was evacuated and closed
following the incident. Students attending schools near the
scene of the fire were safe and sheltering in place, the La
Porte Independent School District said.

paragraph 5, analyst comments in paragraph 6)
    By Vallari  Srivastava 
       July 30 (Reuters) - Electric and gas utility CenterPoint
Energy <CNP.N> said on Tuesday it expects total costs to restore
facilities damaged by Hurricane Beryl to be in the range of $1.2
billion to $1.3 billion.
    Earlier this month, Hurricane Beryl made landfall near the
coastal town of Matagorda, Texas, causing significant damage to
CenterPoint electric subsidiary's delivery system.
    The largest Texas power provider also expects $425 million
to $475 million in additional costs related to storm events that
occurred in May.
    CenterPoint said on a post earnings call that it expects the
storm-related costs to add about 2% to the average residential
electric bills.
    Shares of the company were down 1.6% in afternoon trade.
    Scotiabank analyst Andrew Weisel said Beryl was weighing on
the company's balance sheet, and may impact its rate case
filings in Houston as ""customer satisfaction and public
perception of the utility have taken a hit following the
widespread outages."" 
    Utility companies use rate case proceedings to raise
electricity prices, to boost funding for transmission and
service costs.
    Restaurants in and around Houston have sued CenterPoint
Energy, seeking more than $100 million in damages, alleging
incompetence and negligence in the utility's efforts to restore
power quickly following Hurricane Beryl.
    CenterPoint, which serves about 2.9 million electric
customers in the greater Houston area and southwestern Indiana,
provided details on its plans to reduce the risks related to
future storms.
    The company's net income available to common shareholders
rose to $228 million, or 36 cents per share, in the
second-quarter, from $106 million, or 17 cents per share, a year
earlier, helped by increased demand for electricity during the
peak summer months.

Energy <CNP.N> said on Tuesday it expects total costs to restore
facilities damaged by Hurricane Beryl to be in the range of $1.2
billion to $1.3 billion.
    Earlier this month, Hurricane Beryl made landfall near the
coastal town of Matagorda, Texas, causing significant damage to
CenterPoint electric subsidiary's delivery system.
    Nearly 2.3 million of CenterPoint's customers lost power
after Hurricane Beryl knocked down trees and electricity
infrastructure with its 80 mph winds.
    The company expects to incur additional charges in the range
of $425 million to $475 million related to storm events that
occurred in May, where about 922,000 customers lost power.
    The largest Texas power provider serves about 2.9 million
electric customers in the greater Houston area and southwestern
Indiana.
    Restaurants in and around Houston have sued CenterPoint
Energy, seeking more than $100 million in damages, alleging
incompetence and negligence in the utility's efforts to restore
power quickly following Hurricane Beryl.
    CenterPoint's net income available to common shareholders
rose to $228 million, or 36 cents per share, in the
second-quarter, from $106 million, or 17 cents per share, a year
earlier, helped by increased demand for electricity during the
peak summer months.

    By Arathy Somasekhar
       HOUSTON, July 16 (Reuters) - Restaurants in and around
Houston on Monday filed a class action seeking more than $100
million from U.S. power provider CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N>,
alleging incompetence and negligence in the utility's efforts to
restore power quickly following Hurricane Beryl. 
    About 2.3 million of CenterPoint's customers lost power last
week after Hurricane Beryl knocked down trees and electricity
infrastructure with its 80 mph winds. About 93,000 remained
without power on Tuesday, eight days after the hurricane. 
    The case alleges that CenterPoint, the state's largest power
provider, has failed for years to invest in infrastructure, and
to inspect, maintain and upgrade equipment and to train
personnel. 
    It also alleges that the utility did not have a competent
storm plan in place and failed to adequately respond to the
storm once it impacted the area. 
    Tony Buzbee, a lawyer on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in
an Instagram post the case makes claims for negligence and gross
negligence for ""CenterPoint's repeated failure to do what any
reasonable and competent electricity provider would do and
should do.""
    CenterPoint said it remains focused on restoration efforts,
adding that the company does not comment on potential
litigation. 
    Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday sent a letter to
CenterPoint's chief executive officer directing him to improve
the company's preparation and response practices for the next
severe weather event in Southeast Texas. 
    Abbott requested that CenterPoint provide his office with a
plan by July 31 to address power issues including ways to
eliminate vegetation, ensure sufficient number of pre-staged
workers, accelerate electric pole replacements and improve
communication with customers.
    He said he will issue an executive order that imposes
certain requirements on CenterPoint if it fails to submit a plan
by that date.

       HOUSTON, July 16 (Reuters) - Restaurants in Houston and
nearby regions on Monday filed a class action lawsuit,
collectively seeking over $100 million, against U.S. power
producer CenterPoint Energy Inc <CNP.N> for lack of power
following Hurricane Beryl. 
    About 2.3 million homes and businesses of CenterPoint's
customers lost power last week after Hurricane Beryl ripped out
trees and knocked down electricity infrastructure. About 130,000
continued to remain without power on Tuesday, eight days after
the hurricane. 
    The extent of the outages and the long restoration time
periods frustrated Texans, who questioned CenterPoint's
preparedness to tackle damages from the storm. CenterPoint is
the state's largest power provider. 
    The restaurants include Trattoria Sofia, B.B. Lemon, The
Annie Cafe & Bar and Killen's, according to the class action
petition.  
    Tony Buzbee, a lawyer who ran for Houston city council last
year, said in an Instagram post the case makes claims for
negligence and gross negligence for ""CenterPoint's repeated
failure to do what any reasonable and competent electricity
provider would do and should do.""
    The case alleges that CenterPoint has failed for years to
invest in infrastructure, to inspect, maintain and upgrade
equipment and to train personnel. 
    It also alleges that the utility has failed to have a
competent storm plan in place and failed to adequately respond
to the storm once it impacted the area, Buzbee said. 
    CenterPoint said it remains focused on restoration efforts,
adding that the company does not comment on potential
litigation.

Sunday he would require CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N> to take
immediate action to improve its hurricane preparation and
response efforts to power outages reported in the greater
Houston area due to Hurricane Beryl.
    Abbott said he also asked the Public Utility Commission
(PUC) of Texas to launch an investigation into the company over
its failure to restore power promptly after the hurricane.
    ""To help Texans in the greater Houston area and to avoid a
repeat of unacceptable power outages, I will give CenterPoint
until the end of the month to provide my office with specific
actions to address power outages and reduce the possibility that
power will be lost during a severe weather event,"" Abbott said
during a press conference in Houston.
    Abbott said he would issue an executive order to impose
actions on CenterPoint geared to keep power on if the company
failed to comply.
    CenterPoint, the largest power provider in Texas, said it
was able to restore power to more than 85%, or 1.9 million, of
its impacted customers by Sunday. 
    There are still about 267,797 CenterPoint customers without
power, according to data from PowerOutage.us.
    Beryl, the earliest Category 5 storm on record, made
landfall near the coastal town of Matagorda last Monday,
knocking out power to about 2.7 million homes and businesses in
Texas.
    CenterPoint expects to restore power to 90% of all impacted
customers on Monday and is committed to doing a thorough review

       NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Roughly 1
million people in Texas’s second-largest city are without power
after Hurricane Beryl landed nearby. Utility CenterPoint Energy
<CNP.N> has said electricity won’t be completely restored to
Houston for days. In the meantime, residents are boiling water
to drink, and are looking to fast-food restaurant Whataburger to
track where the lights may be turned on. Such is life in a
fast-growing metropolitan area where policy favored companies
for too long. 
    The Lone Star state prides itself on being
business-friendly, and its lack of personal and corporate income
tax has attracted companies like AT&T <T.N>, Dell Technologies
<DELL.N>, American Airlines <AAL.O>, and Exxon Mobil <XOM.N>.
The population has surged 38% over 20 years, more than twice the
national rate, with recent boosts from incentives for companies
like Toyota Motor <7203.T> and other manufacturers that build
new facilities. The population in the Houston suburb of Fulshear
grew 26% last year, 51 times the nation’s average.
    Infrastructure hasn’t kept up. Journeys on the area’s roads
take 30% longer in the morning, and 19% in the afternoon, than
they did in 2022, according to Houston Transtar. The city is the
second worst in the country for affordable housing, with just 15
domiciles available per 100 people who need them. And the
government predicts rising demand for drinking water, and
declining supplies unless policy changes.
    The troubles in the utility sector are an extension of these
policies. Like the rest of the United States, the industry in
Texas is run mostly by companies. But state officials are tasked
with ensuring power is safely and consistently offered to
residents. They do this by forcing investment to shore up the
grid. But unlike the interconnected grid in the United States,
Texas operates on its own. Some lawmakers worry that the
isolated grid has put Texas at a greater risk of blackouts, and
are looking for Federal oversight.
    Prior warnings have gone unheeded. In 2011, a cold snap
knocked out power plants, causing blackouts. The Texas
government ignored calls to force utilities to invest more. Only
after this happened again in 2021 did the state begrudgingly
force companies to act. Texas may be enamored with letting
business do their own thing, but residents sitting in darkness
drinking boiled water seems like too high a price for that kind
of freedom.

    By Arathy Somasekhar, Curtis Williams and Georgina McCartney
       HOUSTON/FREEPORT, July 11 (Reuters) - About 1 million
homes and businesses in Texas remained without power on
Thursday, four days after Hurricane Beryl lashed the state with
fierce winds and flooding, sparking frustration among companies,
officials and residents who were facing extreme heat. 
    A little more than half of CenterPoint Energy's <CNP.N> 2.3
million customers had power restored by Thursday morning, the
company said, following Beryl's landfall near Matagorda.
CenterPoint is Texas' largest electricity provider.
    Hiccups in the restoration of power are slowing down some
companies' efforts to return operations to normal, especially
around Freeport, among Texas' largest energy hubs. More rain on
Thursday added to the delays.
    However, most oil and gas companies have resumed normal
operations after Beryl made landfall as a Category 1 storm. 
    Freeport LNG, the U.S. third largest liquefied natural gas
(LNG) producer, began pulling in small volumes of natural gas
for processing on Thursday, according to data from financial
firm LSEG. The company has not provided an operational update
since Sunday, when it said it ramped down production.
    A small flare could be seen flickering at the facility,
according to a Reuters witness.
    No vessels were docked at the LNG company's berths, but many
power restoration crews were working in the area with service
trucks arriving from as far as Nebraska and North Carolina,
according to locals interviewed by Reuters.
    ""The major concern of the week over the impact of Hurricane
Beryl on U.S. LNG production has receded,"" said consultancy
Rystad's vice president, Wei Xiong, in a note to clients.    
    The port of Freeport said restrictions for navigating during
daylight could be lifted on Thursday.
    U.S. natural gas futures <NGc1> fell about 2% to a two-month
low on Thursday on a bigger-than-expected weekly storage build
as output rose and the amount of gas flowing to LNG export
plants dropped due to Beryl.
    Chemical maker Olin <OLN.N> on Wednesday declared a force
majeure for some product and aromatic shipments after Beryl
caused damage to its Freeport facilities. The firm said the
duration of the disruption was uncertain, and did not respond to
requests for more details. 
    Formosa Plastics, which temporarily shut down operations at
its Point Comfort plant after a malfunction with a gas
compressor system, said it did not receive any severe damage
from Beryl. The company expects operations to be back to normal
by the end of next week.
    Chemical company BASF <BASFn.DE> said its facilities in
Texas experienced minimal impact from Hurricane Beryl and the
site was working to resume normal operations.
    The ports of Houston, Galveston and Texas City were open on
Thursday, with some of them operating with restrictions that
were expected to be lifted soon. The U.S. Coast Guard on
Thursday afternoon rescinded port conditions issued during
storms, signaling normal operations. 
    The Texas Gulf Coast is home to massive oil and gas
processing facilities, as well as export plants and chemical
manufacturers. Texas accounts for 40% of U.S. oil output and 20%
of the country's natural gas production. 
    Refineries, offshore production sites and ports saw limited
damage and had largely returned to normal operations by
Thursday.
    
    BACKLASH      
    CenterPoint has been facing scrutiny over its preparations
ahead of Beryl and speed of reaction. 
    The utility said on Wednesday it expected to restore power
to an additional 400,000 customers by Friday and 350,000
customers by Sunday. In total, 2.26 million of its customers
lost power in the storm. 
    ""We did not have material damage to our transmission system
or substations or flooding of substations,"" CenterPoint
executive vice president, Jason Ryan, told Texas commissioners
on Thursday.  
    Entergy, which had peak outages of about 252,000 customers
in Texas after the hurricane, said it had restored power to
about 43% of those affected. 
    In Freeport, however, most restaurants remained closed three
days after the storm due to a lack of power. 
    Damaged electric lines could be seen trailing on roads,
according to a Reuters witness. Residents crowded into a
McDonald's restaurant in the area, one of the few places open,
to charge phones. 
    ""We're still picking back up,"" a local said.
    Afternoon rains brought some relief to soaring temperatures
in southeast Texas, which were in the low to mid-90 degrees
Fahrenheit (low to mid-32 degrees Celsius), with heat indices in
the 100s, the National Weather Service said. 
    Damage from Beryl could cost U.S. insurers roughly $2.7
million, catastrophe modeling company Karen Clark & Co said on
Thursday. 
    An insurance adjuster said he was inspecting about 50 houses
in Freeport on Thursday before heading to other coastal towns
impacted by the storm.

Hello Power Up readers! Oil markets have moved on from the
disruption caused by Hurricane Beryl in the Houston area earlier
this week, with traders now trying to reconcile a downbeat
demand outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA) with
signs of recovering consumption in the United States. 
On the ground in Texas, however, over a million customers
remained without power on Thursday after the first major storm
of the season slammed key energy infrastructure.
More on that below, along with other major energy and power
sector news and analysis.
     
Cleaning up after Beryl
 
About 1.3 million customers  remained without power in Texas on
Thursday, three days after Hurricane Beryl lashed the state, as
progress to restore electricity was slow, hampering efforts to
quickly restart critical oil infrastructure.
The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday near
the coastal town of Matagorda, about 100 miles (160 km) from
Houston, lashing Texas with heavy winds that knocked down power
lines and damaged property.
Among Texas' most affected zones by wind damage and lack of
power were cities from Lake Jackson and Galveston on the coast
to Houston, including energy hubs Freeport and Texas City,
according to officials and utility CenterPoint's outages map.
Chemical manufacturer Olin declared force majeure over shipping
of some product and aromatics, saying that Beryl had caused
damage to its Freeport facilities, impacting production and
access to power, raw materials, and feedstocks.
In a letter to the state's largest power provider, CenterPoint,
on Wednesday, Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia said the firm's
inability to restore power more quickly was creating a public
health crisis. ""Hospitals are now unable to send patients home
where they lack power for medical equipment or an appropriately
cool environment for their conditions."" Here's the latest on
that developing story.
     
     
Essential reading
 
Global oil demand growth will slow to just under a million
barrels per day (bpd) this year and next, the International
Energy Agency (IEA) said, as Chinese consumption contracted in
the second quarter due to economic problems.
    BP expects oil demand to peak next year and wind and solar
capacity to grow rapidly in the two main scenarios in its annual
Energy Outlook, a study of the evolution of the global energy
system to 2050 it published on Wednesday.
Combined electricity generation from solar and wind farms in the
United States surpassed output from nuclear plants for the first
time during the opening half of 2024, cementing renewable energy
assets as the primary source of clean power in the country.
Hundreds of oil tankers snake each day from near Kurdistan's
capital Erbil for Turkey to the north and Iran to the east,
clogging the Iraqi region's often winding and mountainous
highways. The tankers are part of a massive operation to truck
oil from the semi-autonomous region of Iraq to Iran and Turkey
in murky, off-the-books transactions that have boomed since an
official export pipeline closed last year. Reuters' Iraq bureau
chief Timour Azhari reports from the region here. 
Europe’s gas storage is filling more slowly than normal this
summer, which has reduced the probability space will run out
before the onset of the main winter heating season.
Australia's electricity producers lifted generation from fossil
fuels by more than from clean power sources during the first
half of 2024, undermining the momentum of the country's energy
transition from polluting fuels.
Portugal plans to increase the weight of renewables to 51% of
its final energy needs by 2030 from a current target of 47% as
part of its goal to become carbon neutral by 2045. 
A rise in European wholesale gas prices over the past several
months could encourage more utilities to switch to coal for
electricity generation this coming winter, even as countries try
to push the carbon-intense fuel out of the power mix.
Almost two-thirds of big wind and solar plants under
construction globally are in China, where surging renewable
capacity has squeezed coal's generation share to new lows,
research released on Thursday showed.
Global hydroelectric generation slumped to a five-year low last
year as a result of lower-than-average rainfall across China,
North America and India, contributing to record fossil fuel
combustion and emissions in 2023. But heavy rains in key regions
look set to lift hydro output in 2024, and cap fossil fuel use
this year.

       July 11 (Reuters) - More than 1.3 million homes and
businesses in Texas remained without power on Thursday, four
days after Hurricane Beryl lashed the state with fierce winds
and heavy flooding, sparking frustration among residents who
were facing extreme heat. 
    Around 1.1 million of those without power were customers of
CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N>, the state's largest provider, data
from PowerOutage.us showed. 
    Although the utility had restored power to 1.16 million
customers since the storm, it was facing increased scrutiny over
its preparations ahead of Beryl. In a letter to CentrePoint,
Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia called the slow restoration of power
a public health crisis.
    CenterPoint said on Wednesday it expected to restore power
to an additional 400,000 customers by Friday and 350,000
customers by Sunday. In total, 2.26 million of is customers lost
power in the storm. 
    ""Crews have identified extensive tree damage across the
company's system. Trees across the Greater Houston area were
particularly vulnerable due to three unusual years of weather,
including significant freezes, drought and heavy rain this past
spring,"" CenterPoint said in a release. 
    Temperatures in southeast Texas were expected to be in the
low to mid-90 degrees Fahrenheit (low to mid-32 degrees Celsius)
on Thursday, with heat indices in the 100s, the National Weather
Service said on Thursday. 
    Damage from Beryl could cost insurers in the United States
roughly $2.7 million, catastrophe modeling company Karen Clark &
Co said on Thursday. 
    Beryl, which made landfall as a Category-1 storm early
Monday morning, shut major ports along the Gulf Coast and
disrupted some refining and production processes, though many
had resumed normal operations by Thursday.
    The Texas Gulf Coast is home to massive oil and gas
processing facilities, as well as export plants and chemical
manufacturers. Texas accounts for 40% of U.S. oil output and 20%
of the country's natural gas production. 
    Freeport LNG, one of the largest liquefied natural gas
facilities in the United States, was set to restart operations
on Thursday, sources told Reuters earlier this week, after
ramping down production for the storm over the weekend. 
    Operations at the facility would be limited by the port,
which continued to operate with restrictions. 
    Chemical maker Olin declared a force majeure for some
product and aromatic shipments after Beryl caused damage to its
Freeport facilities.

8-9, refinery status in 14 and Chevron's update in 21)
    By Arathy Somasekhar, Marianna Parraga and Curtis Williams
       HOUSTON, July 10 (Reuters) - About 1.5 million customers
remained without power in Texas on Wednesday, two days after
Hurricane Beryl raked the state, as progress to restore
electricity was slow, hampering efforts to quickly restart
critical oil infrastructure.
    The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday
near the coastal town of Matagorda, about 100 miles (160 km)
from Houston, lashing Texas with heavy winds that knocked down
power lines and damaged property.    
    ""When you don't have power, when it's pitch black at night,
when it's as hot as 80 (degrees Fahrenheit/26.6 C) during the
day, and you don't have access to food you normally have, it's a
miserable situation,"" Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told
a press conference on Wednesday in Matagorda.
    About 1.3 million of the 1.5 million houses and businesses
without power are customers of CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N>, the
state's largest provider.
    CenterPoint said on Wednesday it had restored power to some
980,000 customers in the previous 24 hours, adding that it would
reach 1 million re-established customers by the end of the day. 
  
    In a letter to CenterPoint on Wednesday, congresswoman
Sylvia Garcia said the firm's inability to restore power more
quickly was creating a public health crisis. ""Hospitals are now
unable to send patients home where they lack power for medical
equipment or an appropriately cool environment for their
conditions.""
    Among Texas' most affected zones by wind damage and lack of
power were cities from Lake Jackson and Galveston on the coast
to Houston, including energy hubs Freeport and Texas City,
according to officials and CenterPoint's outages map.
    Chemical manufacturer Olin <OL.N> declared force majeure
over shipping of some product and aromatics, saying that Beryl
had caused damage to its Freeport facilities, impacting
production and access to power, raw materials, and feedstocks.
    ""The duration of this disruption is uncertain,"" it said in a
statement. 
    Also in that area, Freeport LNG, the second largest U.S.
liquefied natural gas terminal, was preparing to resume
processing by Thursday, two sources close to the matter said, as
power was being restored. But LNG exports from the terminal are
not expected to restart until the port, which is operating under
restrictions, fully reopens for vessel traffic.
    A spokesperson for Freeport LNG told Reuters the company
""intends to resume liquefaction when post-storm assessments are
complete and it is safe to do so.""

     PORTS, PLATFORMS REOPENING
    Refineries, offshore production sites and ports saw limited
damage and were largely returning to normal operations.    
    Two refineries in Texas City, Texas, one operated by
Marathon Petroleum <MPC.N> and the other by Valero Energy Corp
<VLO.N>, were in operation on Wednesday morning, according to a
Reuters eyewitness.           
    The Port of Freeport said on Wednesday the navigation
channel had reopened to vessels with drafts up to 36 feet (10
meters). The port, which moved its first ship, added that survey
would determine when the channel would be cleared for operations
without restrictions.
    ""All Port Freeport entrance gates have resumed normal
operating hours. Utility crews are on-site making repairs to
downed power lines,"" it said.
    The Port of Houston said its eight public terminals had
resumed operations on Tuesday for vessel operations, and on
Wednesday returned to normal start times for gate operations. 
    Houston Pilots, which provides services to ships entering or
departing the port, moved 14 ships inbound on Tuesday and was
expecting 25 inbound and five outbound vessels on Wednesday.
    At the Port of Galveston, cruise ships began to sail while
cargo operations were expected to resume on Wednesday. The port,
which maintains draft restrictions for vessels, experienced
relatively minor damage and some power outages, said Rodger
Rees, Galveston Wharves port director.
   ""Power remains out for areas of the port and the city. Port
staff is working closely with the city to get power fully
restored,"" the ports said on a social media update. 
    U.S. oil producer Chevron <CVX.N> said on Wednesday that
output from its operated Gulf of Mexico assets remained at
normal levels.    
    
    DAMAGES MOUNTING       
    Reinsurance broker Gallagher Re estimated that U.S. economic
losses from Beryl would be at least $1 billion as damage
assessments continue. Weather forecasting firm AccuWeather
issued a preliminary estimate of $28 billion to $32 billion in
U.S. damage and economic loss.    
    State officials promised cooling stations, hospital beds and
a plan to remove debris. President Joe Biden on Tuesday approved
a major disaster declaration for Beryl. 
    With local stores running out of power generators for sale,
many Texans resorted to their trucks to power appliances and
small equipment at home.  
    A Ford Motor <F.N> spokesman said the automaker saw a 1,300%
increase from customers in the Houston region generating at
least 1 kilowatt of power with their built-in F-150 pickup truck
mobile generators.

       HOUSTON, July 10 (Reuters) - About 1.7 million customers
remained without power in Texas on Wednesday morning, two days
after Hurricane Beryl made landfall, as progress was slow during
the night, hampering efforts to restore critical oil
infrastructure.
    The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday
near the coastal town of Matagorda, about 100 miles (160 km)
from Houston, lashing Texas with heavy winds that knocked down
multiple power lines and caused property damage.
    Reinsurance broker Gallagher Re has estimated that U.S.
economic losses from Beryl would be at least $1 billion as
damage assessments remain ongoing, while weather forecasting
firm AccuWeather issued a preliminary estimate of $28 billion to
$32 billion in total damage and economic loss. 
    About 1.4 million of the 1.7 million people without power
were customers of CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N>, the state's
largest provider.
    CenterPoint said on Wednesday it had restored power to more
than 615,000 customers in the last 24 hours, adding that it
remains confident it will restore 1 million impacted customers
by the end of the day. 
    Some customers have questioned whether CenterPoint had
enough crews in place ahead of the storm. Texas Lieutenant
Governor Dan Patrick said an analysis would be conducted after
power is restored. 
    CenterPoint said its crews were positioned in locations
where they would be safe when the storm hit, and were deployed
on Monday when the landfall site was known as soon as it was
safe to do so. 
    Freeport LNG, the third-largest liquefied natural gas
facility in the U.S., reduced production on Sunday and has not
provided an operational update since then.
    Ports along the Texas Gulf Coast, which had shut in ahead of
the hurricane, were reopening with some restrictions. 
    The Port of Houston said it would reopen on Wednesday, after
allowing some in-bound vessels, also with restrictions. 
    Some cruise operations restarted at the Port of Galveston,
while cargo operations were expected to resume on Wednesday.
Some port facilities in Galveston were impacted by lack of power
on Tuesday, limiting operations. 
    The Port of Freeport said it was open and operating, while
shipping agents said certain traffic restrictions remained in
place. Port facilities were running on backup power as utility
crews worked to restore power, the officials for Freeport said
in a statement on Tuesday. 
    Refineries and offshore production facilities saw limited
damage and had largely returned to normal operations.

    By Arathy Somasekhar, Georgina McCartney and Laila Kearney
       HOUSTON, July 9 (Reuters) - Oil and gas companies in
Texas restarted some operations on Tuesday after Hurricane Beryl
lashed the state with 80-mph (129-kph) winds, while some
facilities sustained damage and power had not been fully
restored.
    Beryl's impact on oil and gas production was expected to be
limited. The storm made landfall on Monday near the coastal town
of Matagorda. Energy firms shut operations ahead of its arrival
and Texas' largest ports and navigation channels closed. 
    Some ports reopened on Tuesday and most producers and
facilities were ramping up output. Some were limited by the slow
restoration of power to homes, businesses and industrial
customers.
    Weather forecasting firm AccuWeather issued a preliminary
estimate of $28 billion to $32 billion in total damage and
economic loss from the hurricane in the United States.  
    More than 1.8 million customers remained without power in
Texas on late Tuesday, according to PowerOutage.us, including
some 1.4 million served by provider CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N>.
    The Texas figure was more than double the number of
customers that lost power in May during a weather event in
Houston. It took more than a week for those outages to be
resolved in some city neighborhoods.
    CenterPoint said in a statement that it had restored power
to more than 850,000 customers of the total 2.26 million
impacted, and ""remains confident in restoring 1 million
customers within 48 hours of storm's exit from area"". 
    ""I can't give you a timeline, but it's not going to be
tomorrow,"" Centerpoint's Local Government Relation Manager Paul
Lock replied to a query on when power would be fully restored. 
    Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick urged CenterPoint to
work as quickly as it can to restore power. 
    ""We can do a post-analysis of their success or failures
after we get the power back,"" Patrick added in response to
questions about whether the power company was prepared in
advance of the hurricane.
    Houston was sunny on Tuesday with temperatures in the high
90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2° degrees Celsius), causing problems
as power outages knocked out air conditioning. Many gasoline
stations in Houston were closed due to lack of power or fuel
stocks.
    Beryl lost strength quickly upon making landfall and by
Tuesday was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said. It warned that flash flooding
and tornados remained possible from mid-Mississippi to the Lower
Ohio Valley.
        
    TEXAS FLOODING EASING
    Texas is the largest U.S. oil and gas producing state,
accounting for some 40% of oil and 20% of gas output, and is
also a major shipping and refining hub. Any weather-related
interruption could affect crude and fuel production levels, as
well as imports and exports.
    ""Although the hurricane did not cause severe disruptions in
U.S. oil production and refining so far, several oil ports
remain closed, while vast power outages can weigh on oil
demand,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note.
    Most refineries in Houston and Texas City are designed to
maintain operations even amid heavy rainfall, but some of those
facilities, ports and other energy infrastructure can develop
problems from sustained power interruptions, experts said.
    Marathon Petroleum Corp <MPC.N> was preparing on Monday to
restart multiple units at its 631,000-barrel-per-day (bpd)
Galveston Bay oil refinery in Texas City, sources said. The
plant was awaiting power to restart operations, the company said
in a state regulatory filing. 
    Phillips 66's <PSX.N> 265,000-bpd Sweeny refinery in Texas
returned plants to normal operations after an upset on Monday
caused by Beryl. Citgo Petroleum temporarily reduced production
over the weekend at its 165,000-bpd Corpus Christi plant.
    Ports from Point Comfort through Houston, including
Freeport, Galveston, and Texas City, saw damage along with
substantial operational delays, a shipping agency wrote in a
note to clients. 
    The Port of Corpus Christi reopened ship navigation on
Monday. The Port of Freeport said it reopened on Monday, adding
that some facilities were running on backup power while utility
crews worked to restore electricity. 
    The Houston Ship Channel opened to inbound traffic with
restrictions, a notice from the shipping agent said. Port
Houston said its terminals would be resuming operations on
Wednesday. 
    Vessel and cargo operations at the Port of Galveston, about
50 miles (80 km) from Houston, remained suspended on Tuesday as
power outages continued in parts of the city, said Rodger Rees,
CEO of maritime commercial center Galveston Wharves. 
    At least one cruise ship was cleared to dock at Galveston on
Tuesday.    
    Shell <SHEL.L>, Chevron <CVX.N> and BP <BP.L> started
redeploying personnel who had been evacuated from their Gulf of
Mexico platforms. Exxon Mobil <XOM.N> was assessing its Hoover
offshore platform, while working to restart operations, it said.
    Freeport LNG, the third-largest liquefied natural gas
facility in the U.S., has not provided an operational update
since it said it reduced production on Sunday.
    Enterprise Products Partners' <EPD.N> unit tripped due to
the weather at its natural gas liquids (NGL) processing facility
in Mont Belvieu, in east Texas, according to a filing. 
    Energy Transfer's <ET.N> Mont Belvieu NGL facility was fully
operational on Tuesday, the company said, following issues
reported in a regulatory filing. Mont Belvieu is the pricing
point for North American NGL markets.

       HOUSTON, July 9 (Reuters) - Oil and gas companies in
Texas were restarting operations on Tuesday after Hurricane
Beryl lashed the state with 80-mph winds, damaging property and
leaving millions of people without power.
    Beryl made landfall early on Monday near the coastal town of
Matagorda. Some energy firms shut operations ahead of its
arrival and Texas' largest ports and navigation channels closed.
But its impact on oil and gas production is expected to be
minor.
    On Tuesday, ports were set to reopen, and some producers and
facilities were ramping up output after preventively cutting
down processing. Some were limited by slow restoration of power
to homes, businesses and industrial customers.
    About 2.8 million customers remained without power in Texas
late on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us, including some 2
million served by the state's largest provider, CenterPoint
Energy <CNP.N>.
    The figure was more than double the number of customers that
lost power in May when a weather event bringing strong winds hit
Houston. It took more than a week for those outages to be
resolved in some city neighborhoods.
    CenterPoint, which said the hurricane resulted in
""widespread power outages,"" warned customers that the power
interruptions might last for several days due to the severity of
the storm.

    WATER UP AND DOWN
    Texas is the largest U.S. oil and gas producing state,
accounting for some 40% of oil and 20% of gas output, and is
also a major shipping and refining hub. Any weather-related
interruption could have an impact on crude and fuel production
levels, as well as imports and exports.
    However, flooding in city regions was expected to ease as
water began receding quickly after Beryl's severe rainfall,
which surpassed 11 inches in some areas south of Houston.
    Most refineries in Houston and Texas City are designed to
maintain operations even amid heavy rainfall, but some of those
facilities, ports and other energy infrastructure can develop
problems from sustained power interruptions, according to
experts.
    Phillips 66 <PSX.N> said on Monday its Lake Charles,
Louisiana and Sweeny, Texas refineries had power and were
operating, while Citgo Petroleum temporarily reduced production
over the weekend at its 165,000-bpd Corpus Christi plant.
    Formosa Plastics said on Monday it had temporarily shut down
operations at its Point Comfort plant site.    
    The Port of Corpus Christi reopened ship navigation on
Monday afternoon, but the Port of Houston said its terminals
would remain closed on Tuesday after conducting a preliminary
assessment of facilities and systems.
    Freeport LNG, the third largest liquefied natural gas
facility in the U.S., has not provided an operational update
since it said it ramped-down production on Sunday. 
    Beryl is expected to gradually lose strength and become a
tropical depression, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on
Monday. The storm was moving north-northeastward before
accelerating across the lower Mississippi Valley into the Ohio
Valley in the next days.

    By Erwin Seba and Arathy Somasekhar
       HOUSTON, July 8 (Reuters) - The Texas energy industry
was evaluating the impact from Hurricane Beryl on Monday after
the powerful storm lashed the U.S. Gulf Coast, closing key
shipping ports and hitting the oil refining and production
sectors. 
    Beryl made landfall near the coastal town of Matagorda,
Texas, on Monday morning, packing maximum sustained winds of 80
mph (129 kph) and posing problems for the heart of the country's
energy sector. 
    The storm had strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane before
landfall, but was downgraded to a tropical storm mid-morning and
began weakening throughout the day. It is forecast to move
across eastern Texas and into the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Ohio Valley later in the week, according to the U.S. National
Hurricane Center (NHC). 
    Texas is the largest U.S. oil and gas producing state,
accounting for some 40% of the country's oil output and 20% of
gas production.
    U.S. crude futures <CLc1> settled 83 cents lower at $82.33 a
barrel on Monday as hopes of a ceasefire deal in Gaza eased
global supply concerns and capped gains driven by storm-related
disruptions. 
    U.S. fuel futures were also trading lower as major
refineries along the Gulf Coast so far appeared to see minimal
impacts from the storm.  
    ""Since the storm has threaded the needle between the two
major production hubs in Corpus Christi and Houston, it seems
that the threat of regional supply disruptions has passed,"" said
fuel marketer TAC Energy, noting that only Phillips 66's <PSX.N>
Sweeny, Texas, facility was in the immediate path of the storm. 
    Phillips 66 said its Sweeny and Lake Charles, Louisiana
refineries had power and were operating.
    More than 2.7 million homes and business in Texas were
without power on Monday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us.
    CenterPoint Energy, which provides power to the southern and
eastern parts of the state, had 2.2 million customers without
electricity, the company said, warning that outages may last for
several days.
    Heavy winds swept through Houston on Monday as streets and
waterways flooded, according to Reuters witnesses and images on
social media. 
    At least two people had died in the Houston area as a result
of falling trees during the storm, according to Harris County
Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.
    
        ENERGY INDUSTRY HIT
    The ship channel that leads to the Port of Corpus Christi,
the country's leading crude oil export hub, reopened on Monday
afternoon after having no significant impact from the storm.
    The port and the channel had closed on Sunday. At least
three vessels entered the Corpus Christi bay on Monday, ship
tracking data on Kpler and LSEG showed. 
    Gibson Energy <GEI.TO> said its Gateway crude export
terminal in Corpus Christi was operational. Enbridge <ENB.TO>,
which also runs crude oil export facilities near Corpus Christi,
said all of its assets, with the exception of its Tres Palacios
gas storage facility, were operational. 
    Terminal operations at the Port of Houston will remain
closed on Tuesday as it continues to assess and repair damage on
Monday afternoon, the port said in a statement.
    ""We are still dealing with rain and wind,"" a spokesperson
said. 
    The port closure left a few vessels stranded off Galveston,
said Rohit Rathod, an analyst at energy data firm Vortexa,
adding that congestion should ease from Tuesday without a major
impact on weekly trade flows.
    Shell <SHEL.L> and Chevron <CVX.N> said they had shut
production or evacuated personnel from their Gulf of Mexico
offshore platforms. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico produces some 1.8
million barrels per day of oil, roughly 14% of total U.S.
output. It was not immediately clear how much production had
been shut in as a result of Beryl. 
    Freeport LNG, the third-largest liquefied natural gas
facility in the U.S., said over the weekend it had ramped down
production and it would resume operations after the storm had
passed. 
    Formosa Plastics, meanwhile, experienced a malfunction with
a gas compressor system during a shutdown for the storm at its
Point Comfort facility, according to a state regulatory filing.
Formosa said it has temporarily shut down operations at its
Point Comfort plant site, and it is actively monitoring the
situation. 
    Refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp reduced production over the
weekend at its 165,000 barrel-per-day Corpus Christi plant,
sources said.
    Marathon Petroleum <MPC.N> declined to comment on its
585,000-bpd Galveston Bay refinery operations. Chevron did not
provide specific comments on the status of its Pasadena refinery
southeast of Houston, and LyondellBasell <LYB.N> declined to
comment on its 268,000-bpd Houston refinery.

       HOUSTON, July 8 (Reuters) - The Texas energy industry
braced for storm Beryl's impact on Monday, with threats from the
intensifying weather system forcing the closure of key oil and
gas shipping ports, slowing refining and prompting the
evacuation of some production sites.  
    Beryl, which national forecasters say could strengthen into
a Category 2 hurricane when it makes U.S. landfall - expected in
the early morning hours in the middle-Texas coast - poses
problems for the heart of the country's energy sector.
    Texas produces the most oil and natural gas, or more than
40% and 20%, respectively, of any area of the United States.
    Over the weekend, the port of Corpus Christi, which is the
country's leading crude oil export hub, closed operations and
vessel traffic in preparation for Beryl. The ports of Houston,
Galveston, Freeport and Texas City also shut ahead of the
landfall. 
    Chemical company Chemours Co <CC.N> said on Sunday that it
was prepared to adjust staffing and secure equipment during and
after the storm passed, while Freeport LNG said it had its
hurricane preparedness plan in place.   
    Enbridge Inc <ENB.TO>, which runs crude oil export
facilities near Corpus Christi, also said it had activated
emergency plans for assets along or near the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
    Citgo Petroleum Corp, meanwhile, was reducing production
over the weekend at its 165,000 barrel-per-day Corpus Christi,
Texas, refinery, sources said.
    Producers, including Shell <SHEL.L> and Chevron <CVX.N>,
also shut in production or evacuated personnel from their Gulf
of Mexico offshore platforms.
    More than 26,000 homes and businesses were without power in
Texas as of Sunday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.
    Texas-based electric utility CenterPoint said in an email
that it was ""closely monitoring the situation and making
preparations.""
    The storm is forecast to turn north-eastward and move
farther inland over eastern Texas and Arkansas late Monday and
Tuesday.

    By Arathy Somasekhar, Marianna Parraga and Erwin Seba
       HOUSTON, July 7 (Reuters) - The largest ports in Texas
closed operations and vessel traffic on Sunday as Hurricane
Beryl intensified as it approached the Texas coast near
Houston.  
    Beryl, which left a trail of destruction this week in the
Caribbean, killing at least 11 people, was now a category 1
hurricane and may strengthen into a category 2 by landfall on
Monday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said
    The ports of Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston, Freeport
and Texas City said they closed after condition ""Zulu"" was set
by Coast Guard captains on Sunday. All vessel movement and cargo
operations are restricted as gale force winds are expected
within 12 hours. 
    Corpus Christi, about 200 miles (322 km) from Houston, is
the top crude oil export hub in the United States. Texas City,
and Freeport also are major oil and refined products shipping
hubs on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
    Port closures could bring a temporary halt to crude exports,
oil shipments to refineries, and motor fuels from those plants.
    The 52-mile (83 kms) Houston ship channel, which on Sunday
operated under transit restrictions before halting all traffic,
allows access to 8 public facilities and some 200 private
terminals. 
    The NHC in its 11 p.m. CDT (0400 GMT) advisory said reports
from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that Beryl's maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75
mph (120 kmh). 
    Additional strengthening is expected before landfall on the
Texas coast, the NHC said on late Sunday.  
    Almost 14,000 customers in Texas had lost electricity on
Sunday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. Power provider
Centerpoint Energy <CNP.N> said it was monitoring the storm and
making preparations.    
        Acting Texas Governor Dan Patrick urged people who were
on vacation in coastal areas to leave before the storm arrival.
    ""It's a serious storm and you must take it seriously and be
prepared,"" he said in a meeting with officials in Austin. 
    
        PREPARED
    Energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan <KMI.N> said on
Sunday it shut its West Clear Lake and Dayton natural gas
storage facilities, and its Texas City natural gas processing
facility ahead of the storm. 
    ""We expect this to have minimal impact on our pipeline
operations,"" it said. All the company's other facilities in the
storm's path remain operational.
    Some energy facilities in Texas had to shut or slow down
operations because of wind storms linked to Beryl. 
    Freeport LNG's liquefaction trains 1, 2 and 3 and a
pre-treatment facility were proactively shutdown due to impacts
associated with Beryl. Plant operators later restarted them ""as
efficiently as possible to minimize flaring,"" according to a
filing with The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. 
    Freeport said on Sunday that it had ramped down production
at its liquefaction facility and intends to resume operations
once it is safe to do so after the weather event.
    Liquefied natural gas producer Cheniere Energy <LNG.N> said
on Sunday its Corpus Christi facility was operating without
interruptions, but all nonessential personnel were released.
    ""Our Gulf Coast assets have robust and proven severe-weather
preparedness,"" it said in a release.
    Chemical maker Chemours Co <CC.N>, which has a production
facility near Corpus Christi, said on Sunday it escalated its
hurricane preparedness plans ""to include planning for safe and
adequate staffing during and after the storm and securing
equipment and assets, should the storm make landfall near our
site.""    
    Enbridge Inc <ENB.TO>, which operates large crude export
facilities near Corpus Christi, said all U.S. Gulf assets were
operational, adding that they had activated emergency plans. 
    Gibson Energy <GEI.TO>, which also operates an export
facility in the area, said on Sunday all Gateway and Houston
based employees were safe, and facilities and docks were secured
after the port of Corpus Christi closure. 
    Citgo Petroleum Corp was cutting production at its 165,000
barrel-per-day Corpus Christi refinery on Saturday, sources
said. The refiner plans to keep the plant in operation at
minimum during Beryl's passage.
    Some oil producers, including Shell <SHEL.L> and Chevron
<CVX.N>, had also shut in production or evacuated personnel from
their Gulf of Mexico offshore platforms.

Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit on Tuesday,
helped by base rate hikes for its Minnesota gas business and
favorable weather which helped the performance of its
electricity transmission unit.
    CenterPoint's service territories experienced a cold snap at
the start of the year, which helped boost customer demand for
electricity.
    In its electric unit, the company saw higher usage with
metered customers rising 2% from last year, while total
throughput supplied increased 6%.
    Additionally, Minnesota regulators approved the company's
rate increase request in December, which resulted in rise in
customers bills starting January. 
    CenterPoint delivers natural gas to about 4 million homes
and businesses in six states - Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Ohio and Texas.
    Houston Electric, CenterPoint's subsidiary, also filed for
its Texas System Resiliency Plan which could provide up to $500
million in incremental capital investment. 
    ""I am excited about the opportunity to further collaborate
with various stakeholders on the first of its kind System
Resiliency Plan in Texas for a range of investments of $2.2
billion to $2.7 billion over the next three years,"" CEO Jason
Wells said.
    The Houston, Texas-based firm posted an adjusted profit of
55 cents per share for the three-month period ended March 31,
above the analysts' average estimate of 53 cents per share,
according to LSEG data.
   CenterPoint reaffirmed its full-year adjusted profit outlook
of between $1.61 and $1.63 per share and maintained its adjusted
profit growth target through 2030 of 6%-8% annually.

quote in paragraph 10)
       Feb 20 (Reuters) - CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N> said on
Tuesday it would sell its natural gas assets in Louisiana and
Mississippi for $1.2 billion to Bernhard Capital Partners, as
the electric and gas utility plans to focus on its regulated
business.
    Several U.S. utilities have disposed of their unregulated
assets to avoid relying on returns dictated by market dynamics,
while regulated operations offer steady returns that are
preferred by investors. 
    Last year, Duke Energy <DUK.N> and American Electric Power
<AEP.O> announced sales of unregulated assets.
    In regulated states, a utility could be responsible for
electricity generation, transmission and distribution, while in
non-regulated states, generation is separate from distribution
and transmission, and consumers can choose to buy their power
from different providers.
    ""From an operational and strategic perspective, we remain
confident in and committed to our regulated natural gas
utilities in Texas, Indiana, Minnesota, and Ohio where we have
significant footprints and rate bases,"" said CEO Jason Wells in
a statement.
    CenterPoint plans to use the roughly $1 billion in expected
cash proceeds, after taxes, from the sale toward capital
investments in locations with fewer regulatory constraints and
where the utility already has a large presence.
    CenterPoint said the assets being sold include 12,000 miles
(19,312 kilometers) of main pipelines, which serve about 380,000
customers in Louisiana and Mississippi.
    The deal is expected to close toward the end of the first
quarter of 2025 and not affect the company's targeted adjusted
profit growth rate of 8% in 2024, and the mid-to-high end of
6%-8% annually from 2025 through 2030.
    CenterPoint raised its capital expenditures plan through
2030 by $600 million to $44.5 billion. Last year, its capital
investments hit $4.3 billion, about 20% above CenterPoint's
forecast at the start of 2023, mainly to invest in its Texas
network.
    ""We made the decision to increase the amount of planned work
on our systems, principally related to critical investments to
improve resiliency and reliability in our Houston Electric
service territory,"" Wells said on a call with investors.
    CenterPoint reported fourth-quarter revenue of $2.18
billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $2.69 billion,
according to LSEG data, while adjusted profit of 32 cents was
in-line with expectations.
    The company said growth and rate recovery in the quarter was
offset by increased interest expense.
