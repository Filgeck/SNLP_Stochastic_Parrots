       Dec 9 (Reuters) - Packaging firm Novolex will buy rival
Pactiv Evergreen <PTVE.O> in a $6.7 billion deal, as the Apollo
Global Management-owned <APO.N> firm looks to bolster its
business of food and beverage packaging in a cautious economic
environment.
    Novolex will offer $18 per share to take Pactiv private in
an all-cash transaction, including debt, the companies said on
Monday. 
    The deal represents a 32.4% premium to Pactiv's closing
price on Dec. 2, a day before Bloomberg News first reported that
Novolex was considering purchasing the company.
    Shares of Pactiv, which sells its products to restaurants,
retailers, food and beverage producers, packers and processors,
jumped about 19%.
    Packaging firms have been scouting for deals as easing
demand following a boom fueled by e-commerce during the pandemic
sparked consolidation in the sector.
    Last month, Switzerland-based Amcor <485.F> <AMCR.N> agreed
to buy U.S. peer Berry Global <BERY.N> for $8.4 billion.
International Paper <IP.N> said in April it would buy British
paper and packaging firm DS Smith <SMDS.L>.
    Lower sales volumes in the food and beverage merchandising
segment even led to a decline in Pactiv's third-quarter revenue
last month. The company also reported a loss during the period,
hurt by a rise in raw material costs.
    The Novolex-Pactiv deal, supported by funds managed by
affiliates of Apollo and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board,
would allow the merged company to deliver 250 brands, along with
expanded distribution, across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
    The combined firm will be led by Novolex Chairman and CEO
Stan Bikulege.
    Barclays Bank, Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital Markets are
the financial advisers to Novolex, while Goldman Sachs and
Lazard Freres are advisers to Pactiv.

expressed are her own.  Updates to add graphic.)
    By Karen Kwok
       LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amcor’s
<AMCR.N> $8.4 billion purchase of U.S. rival Berry Global
<BERY.N> may test the limits of packaging M&A. The all-share
deal revealed on Tuesday involves a paper-thin premium, low
valuation and plenty of cost savings. But the Swiss-based
acquirer’s investors have showed little enthusiasm for the deal,
with its shares declining 3% on the day. The target’s debt and
sluggish business may explain why.
    On the surface, the deal more than stacks up for Amcor’s
shareholders. The group run by Peter Konieczny has agreed to pay
a premium of less than 10% for Berry, in an all-share deal that
leaves its shareholders with 63% of the combined company.
Including net debt, the $15.7 billion offer values Berry at 7.6
times the EBITDA analysts expected it to generate in 2025, using
LSEG data. That’s below Amcor’s own 10.1 times multiple. On
average historical packaging deals transact at 8.7 times,
according to Capstone Partners data.
    The two companies expect just below $600 million of funding
and cost savings. Taxed at 22% and capitalised using a 10%
discount rate, the present value of Amcor shareholders’ 63%
share is $2.6 billion, comfortable exceeding the $750 million
premium they are paying. Add the savings to 2027 forecast EBIT
of $1.2 billion, again using LSEG data, take off tax, and the
return on invested capital will be roughly 9%, above the
sector’s likely 7% cost of capital. That’s before factoring in
any of the revenue synergies Amcor is also touting.
    Yet the deal also brings headaches, not least the complexity
of a large integration. Analysts expect Berry’s revenue to drop
2% on average each year through 2027, using LSEG data, relative
to the average 5% growth estimated in the sector, according to
analysts’ estimates provided by LSEG. Berry’s $7.2 billion of
net debt, which was just below 4 times EBITDA last year, is
another bother.
    And the combined group will still have to grapple with the
broader challenges faced by the packaging sector: the growth
spurt from pandemic-era online shopping has faded, and companies
are facing rising raw material and other costs. They are also
coming under pressure from regulators and shareholders to cut
waste and use more recyclable materials, which will increase
costs. Small wonder companies are teaming up: International
Paper <IP.N>, for example, recently agreed to buy DS Smith
<SMDS.L> for $9.9 billion, and there have been 135 packaging
transactions so far this year according to Capstone Partners. By
buddying up, Amcor and Berry will together have a more
diversified business and be able to pool research costs.
    Still, the deal also suggests that even financially savvy
M&A can only go so far.

    By Sabrina Valle
       Nov 19 (Reuters) - Switzerland-based Amcor Plc <485.F>
<AMCR.N> on Tuesday agreed to buy U.S. peer Berry Global
<BERY.N> for $8.43 billion in an all-stock deal, creating a
consumer and healthcare packaging giant with combined revenues
of $24 billion. 
    As part of the transaction, Berry's shareholders will
receive $73.59 per share, representing a premium of 9.75% to the
stock's last close. Berry's shares were up 1% in afternoon
trading. 
    A sharp slowdown in demand for packaging material following
a boom fueled by e-commerce during the pandemic has sparked
consolidation in the sector.
    In April, U.S.-based International Paper <IP.N> agreed to an
all-share deal for DS Smith that valued the British packaging
firm at 5.8 billion pounds ($7.2 billion).
    Amcor and Berry make cartons, closures and containers for
food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care,
industries, and will have footprint across more than 140
countries.
    The deal is by far Amcor's largest acquisition to date. In
2019, it bought U.S. rival Bemis in a $5.25 billion all-stock
deal but had to divest three manufacturing facilities to gain
approval from the U.S. Justice Department.
    On a call with analysts, Amcor CEO Peter Konieczny said he
did not foresee any exposure to regulatory approvals in the deal
with Berry, pointing toward relatively lesser overlaps. 
    Konieczny will serve as CEO of the combined company, which
is expected to generate adjusted earnings of $4.3 billion. The
transaction is expected to result in synergies of about $650
million by the end of the third year after the closing of the
deal, which is expected to happen in the middle of 2025. 
    The combined entity will be named Amcor Plc, with a primary
listing on the NYSE. The transaction, which will result in Amcor
holding 63% in the combined entity, has been unanimously
approved by the boards of both companies. 
    Amcor and Berry initiated talks on a potential deal earlier
this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    UBS <UBSG.S>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, and Kirkland & Ellis
advised Amcor on the deal, while Lazard <LAZ.N>, Wells Fargo
<WFC.N> and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom advised Berry.
    Separately, Berry posted a fourth-quarter adjusted profit of
$2.27 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of
$2.25, according to data compiled by LSEG.

2024,AMCR.N,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20241031:nL4N3M72G4:1,2024-10-31 21:12:24.000,Amcor misses quarterly sales estimates on weaker demand in North American business,"Oct 31 (Reuters) - Packaging firm Amcor <485.F> <AMCR.N>
missed first-quarter sales estimates on Thursday, hurt by weaker
demand for its containers and cartons from consumer goods
companies.
    Separately, the company said it would be selling its 50%
interest in joint venture Bericap North America for $122
million, sending its shares down about 4% in extended trading.
    Amcor's sales took a hit by sluggish customer demand and an
impact from consistent destocking in healthcare packaging
categories.
    Its quarterly sales volumes remained soft in the North
American beverage business — a major revenue-generating region
—  along with categories including healthcare, home and personal
care product packaging. 
The company's customers, such as PepsiCo <PEP.O> and Procter &
Gamble <PG.N>, have been grappling with frugal consumer
spending.
    Amcor posted quarterly sales of $3.35 billion in the quarter
ended Sept. 30, compared with analysts' estimates of $3.49
billion, as per data compiled by LSEG.
    However, benefits from consecutive price hikes in its rigid
packaging segment, as well as cost-cutting measures and easing
raw material costs, aided Amcor in edging past analysts'
estimates for profit.
    On an adjusted basis, Amcor posted first-quarter earnings of
16.2 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate
of 16 cents per share.
    Bericap North America, which was established in 1997, is
Amcor's joint venture with Germany-based firm Bericap, a
manufacturer of plastic lids for beverage food and other
industrial end markets.
    Upon closing around Dec. 31, cash proceeds will be used to
reduce debt, said Amcor, and it does not expect the transaction
to have an impact on its financial outlook for fiscal 2025. 
    The packaging products maker reaffirmed its annual adjusted
profit forecast of 72 cents to 76 cents per share.

Video Transcript:

US stocks ended higher on Friday to record their biggest weekly percentage
gains of the year as worries of an economic downturn eased. The Dow added
about 0.25%. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ each rose 0.20%, marking the seventh
straight session of gains for both. Stocks recouped losses from their tailspin
two weeks ago. The sell-off was sparked by weak economic data and heightened
recession fears. But a barrage of high-profile economic data this week,
including the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index and a retail sales
report from the Commerce Department, provided assurances that inflation
continues to ease, and consumer spending remains healthy. Joy Yang is Head of
Product Management and Marketing at MarketVector Indexes.

So, we saw last week a dramatic fall across the board in markets. And perhaps
we've overreacted. But if you take a step back and look at year-to-date,
markets are pretty strong. If you were on a holiday and you didn't look at the
news and you came back, you would see that the S&P pretty strong year-to-date
and it's close to 20%. NVIDIA still above over 100%, you look at gold, you
look at bitcoin, they're still really positive and strong numbers
year-to-date.

Stocks on the move included Applied Materials, which slid about 2%, reversing
its surge after the chipmaking equipment firm forecast stronger-than-expected
fourth-quarter revenue. US-listed shares of Amcor dropped more than 3.5% after
the packaging company posted a bigger-than-expected decline in fourth-quarter
sales. Investors turn their focus next week to the Federal Reserve symposium
in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a keynote
speech that will potentially offer clues about when the central bank will
start cutting rates."

       NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on
Friday, extending their biggest weekly percentage gains of the
year as worries of an economic downturn eased and investors
focused on the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium next week.
    The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq notched their seventh straight
session of gains, as stocks recouped losses from a tailspin two
weeks ago. The sell-off, sparked by weak economic data and
heightened recession fears, confirmed the Nasdaq had entered
correction territory.
    All three indexes recorded their biggest weekly percentage
gains since late October, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq
posting their first weekly gain in five.
    ""What were seeing in today's markets is an extension of the
comeback and the calming of earlier recession fears,"" said Greg
Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments in New York. 
    ""The positive economic data is really what's fueling this
rally, giving greater confidence to investors that are recession
is likely to be avoided, and that the Fed will begin cutting
rates in September.""
    A barrage of high profile economic data this week, including
the Labor Department's consumer price index and a retail sales
report from the Commerce Department, provided assurances that
inflation continues meandering down toward the Federal Reserve's
2% target, and that consumer spending is healthy.
    Data on Friday showed U.S. single-family housing starts
dropped to a near 1-1/2-year low in July, while the University
of Michigan's preliminary take on August consumer sentiment
showed stronger-than-expected improvement.
    Global central bank officials will speak at the symposium in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's
keynote speech on Friday potentially setting expectations for a
U.S. rate cut trajectory.
    ""All eyes are going to be laser-focused on Powell's comments
next week,"" Bassuk said. ""Market activity this year has
consistently been based on the likelihood and extent of Fed rate
cuts.""
    Chicago Fed chief Austan Goolsbee said in an interview with
National Public Radio that central bank officials should be wary
of maintaining restrictive policy longer than necessary.  
    Financial markets are betting on a 74.5% likelihood that the
Fed will cut its key policy rate by 25 basis points as it ends
its September policy meeting, with a diminishing 25.5% chance of
a super-sized 50-basis-point cut, CME's FedWatch tool showed.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 96.7 points, or
0.24%, to 40,659.76. The S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 11.03 points, or
0.20%, at 5,554.25 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 37.22
points, or 0.21%, at 17,631.72.
        Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, financials
<.SPSY> enjoyed the biggest percentage gain, while industrials
<.SPLRCI> suffered the largest drop.
  
    Applied Materials <AMAT.O> slid 1.9%, reversing its surge
after the chip-making equipment firm forecast
stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue.
    Amcor <AMCR.N> posted a bigger-than-anticipated decline in
fourth-quarter sales. The packaging company's U.S.-listed shares
dropped 3.7% in the wake of the report.
    Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a
2.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
        The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and no new lows;
the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 85 new lows. 
  
        Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.11 billion shares,
compared with the 12.27 billion average for the full session
over the last 20 trading days.

    By Stephen Culp
       NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on
Friday, extending their biggest weekly percentage gains of the
year as worries of an economic downturn eased and investors
focused on the Jackson Hole symposium next week.
    The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were poised to notch their
seventh straight session of gains, as stocks recouped losses
from a tailspin two weeks ago, which was brought on by weak
economic data and heightened fears of recession and confirmed
the Nasdaq had entered correction territory.
    All three indexes are on course for their biggest weekly
percentage gains since October, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq
on track for their first weekly gain in five.
    ""It has been a great week, and it has been a great year.
There's been some volatility, but major indices are all up
nicely,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at
Wealthspire Advisors in New York.
    ""What we saw a couple weeks ago was the market blowing off
some steam.""
    A barrage of high profile economic data this week, including
the Labor Department's consumer price index and a retail sales
report from the Commerce Department, provided assurances that
inflation continues meandering down toward the Fed's goal, and
American consumer is alive and well.
    Data on Friday showed U.S. single-family housing starts
dropped to a near 1-1/2-year low in July, while the University
of Michigan's preliminary take on August consumer sentiment
showed stronger-than-expected improvement.
    ""Economic news continues to be decent and some of the data
that has come out his week has fueled the rally, suggesting
fears of an imminent recession are overblown,"" Pursche said.
""Inflation continues to come down and the probability of the Fed
lowering rates by 25 basis point in September are now pretty
high.""
    Global central bank officials will speak at the symposium in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week, with Federal Reserve Chair
Jerome Powell's keynote speech on Friday potentially setting
expectations for a U.S. rate cut trajectory. 
    Chicago Fed chief Austan Goolsbee said in an interview with
National Public Radio that central bank officials should be wary
of maintaining restrictive policy longer than necessary.
    Financial markets are betting on a 74.5% likelihood that the
Fed will cut its key policy rate by 25 basis points as it ends
its September policy meeting, with a diminishing 25.5%
possibility of a super-sized 50-basis-point cut, CME's FedWatch
tool showed.
    As of 2:04 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>
rose 108.6 points, or 0.27%, to 40,671.66, the S&P 500 <.SPX>
gained 11.85 points, or 0.21%, at 5,555.07 and the Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> added 44.71 points, or 0.25%, at 17,639.21.
    Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, financials
<.SPSY> enjoyed the biggest percentage gain, while real estate
<.SPLRCR> was down the most.
    Applied Materials <AMAT.O> slid 1.7%, reversing its surge
after the chip-making equipment firm forecast
stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue.
    Amcor <AMCR.N> posted a bigger-than-anticipated decline in
fourth-quarter sales. The packaging company's U.S.-listed shares
dropped 4.9% in the wake of the report.
    Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a
2.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
    The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 73 new lows.

<AMCR.N> reported a more-than-expected decline in fourth-quarter
sales on Thursday, hurt by weaker demand for its containers and
cartons.
    Volumes for the company's products in rigid packaging fell
due to persistent destocking in healthcare categories in North
America — a major revenue-generating region.
    Sales were also hurt by lower volumes in North American
beverage business through the quarter ended June 30.
    Quarterly sales at Amcor — which counts Cadbury parent
Mondelez International <MDLZ.O> and beverage maker PepsiCo
<PEP.O> as its customers — dropped 4% to $3.54 billion. Analysts
on average estimated 1% decline to $3.64 billion, according to
LSEG data.
    Peer International Paper <IP.N> also saw a slowdown in
demand for its corrugated packaging containers in the latest
quarter.
    Amcor's adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were at
21.1 cents per share, edging past analysts' estimate of 20
cents, aided by easing raw material costs.
    The company expects adjusted earnings per share for fiscal
2025 to be between 72 and 76 cents, the midpoint of which was in
line with analysts' estimate of 74 cents.
    It posted adjusted profit of 70.2 cents per share for fiscal

    By Valentina Za
       MILAN, March 20 (Reuters) - Europe's debt collectors
have gone from feast to famine amid a collapse in the number of
bank loans turning sour.
    Companies that recover unpaid bank debts, and which thrived
in the aftermath of the euro zone sovereign debt crisis, are
rethinking their business models and examining tie-ups with
rivals after COVID-19, an energy crisis and two-decade-high
interest rates failed to unleash a new wave of loan defaults.
    Banks in Europe's south have largely completed the clean-ups
that once fed the bad loan bonanza and pulled in overseas
investment firms such as Apollo <APO.N>, Cerberus, PIMCO,
Elliott and Lone Star, while government support measures have
helped keep companies and households on their feet.
    Non-performing loans (NPLs) have held at 1.8% of total bank
loans in Europe for six straight quarters, official data show. 
    In Italy, the continent's biggest market for bad debts,
sales last year totalled 31 billion euros ($34 billion), a third
of the 2018 peak. Back then, virtually all disposals came from
banks, while more than half of the total in 2023 were re-sales.
    Shares in some of the continent's main players including
Sweden's Intrum <INTRUM.ST> - Europe's biggest debt collector -
and Italian leader doValue <DOVA.MI> hit record lows this month
as investors weigh whether efforts to restructure their business
can work. Both companies declined to comment. 
    ""Several players are undergoing a metamorphosis,"" said
Francesco Cataldo, a director at consultancy PwC Strategy& in
Milan.    
    Keeping loan managers in activity is important because they
can provide a new lease of life to assets - sometimes businesses
or properties - that are tied up in insolvency or restructuring
procedures, helping economic growth.    
    HIGHER DEBT COSTS, LOWER BAD LOAN FLOWS
    Many collectors have not only stopped buying new impaired
loans now that debt costs make that economically unviable, but
are also shedding assets bought in the past.
    Intrum, whose shares are down 78% this year, in January sold
a nominal 33 billion euro loan portfolio to Cerberus, retaining
management of the loans and using the cash to cut its recently
downgraded debt. It is working with advisers to improve its debt
position.
    Similarly, Italy's Mediobanca <MDBI.MI> in October quit the
NPL investment business and sold its arm that held a nominal 6.5
billion euros in bad loans.
    Intrum's 'capital light' model was embraced last week by
Italian state-owned bad loan manager AMCO when it presented a
new three-year strategy, saying it would reduce loans under
management and cut its financial debt to zero.
    ""Banks have minimal impaired loan levels and high capital
buffers,"" AMCO said, pointing to structurally lower new bad loan
flows and mounting competition in the sector, where firms must
comply with new European Union regulation by mid-2024.
    Banks' healthy loan books also threaten collectors that
never invested directly in NPLs, relying instead on contracts
with lenders outsourcing debt recovery. As they gradually
expire, those multi-year contracts may not be renewed.
    Italy's doValue, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group
<9984.T> and has a key UniCredit <CRDI.MI> contract ending in
2025, is expected to outline alternative revenue sources when it
presents a new strategy on Thursday.
    Its shares have lost 47% this year after it reported a 2023
loss on an impairment it booked on its operations in Spain,
where it lost a major contract in 2022.
        
    M&A REVIVAL
    In a crowded market, mergers offer an obvious way for debt
collectors to reduce competition and increase scale.
    But investment bankers say the poor performance of listed
bad loan specialists renders valuations unattractive for
sellers.
    Multiple deals have been explored but failed to go through
in recent years, with varied business models making it hard to
set price tags that would spur big investment funds to sell the
debt servicers they bought in the boom times, the bankers said.
    Hopes of an M&A revival are now pinned on fintech group
ION's 1.3 billion euro acquisition of Italian loan manager
Prelios from U.S. hedge fund Davidson Kempner. 
    Valued at around nine times its core profit, Prelios could
set a benchmark for future deals, two industry sources said.
    ION gained government clearance this month to buy Prelios
and now needs central bank approval. It is then expected to
merge Prelios with Cerved, another NPL business it bought in
2021.
    Italian authorities fret over the troubles of a sector that
is key for the billions of euros of loans offloaded by banks,
people familiar with their thinking said.
    ""Though new NPL inflows are low, we shouldn't forget that in
Italy alone some 250 billion euros in problem debts are still
largely out there. Behind those loans there are businesses and
families whose debt issues remain unsolved,"" Cataldo said.

<AMCR.N> missed market expectations for second-quarter sales on
Tuesday, hurt by softer demand for its containers and cartons.
    The company's volumes were dragged by weaker demand from
customers such as Cadbury parent Mondelez International <MDLZ.O>
 trimming their inventory levels on lower demand from
cash-strapped consumers.
    Its peers including International Paper <IP.N> and WestRock
<WRK.N> also struggled with weakening demand for their packaging
products.
    The company said that inventory destocking in the beverages
segment accelerated ""considerably"" in the reported quarter due
to lower consumer demand. In North America, overall beverage
volumes were 19% lower than same period last year. 
    Softer demand in categories such as healthcare, snacks and
coffee also dampened net sales in Europe.
    Still, the company maintained its fiscal 2024 adjusted
earnings per share forecast, with CEO Ron Delia adding that
Amcor saw volumes improve in January.
    Amcor's net sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023 fell
to $3.25 billion from $3.64 billion last year, compared with
analysts' expectation of $3.63 billion, as per LSEG data.
