       Dec 12 (Reuters) - Parnassus, one of the largest asset
managers to offer products tied to environmental, social or
governance considerations, launched its first exchange-traded
funds on Thursday amid a difficult environment for the strategy.
    As performance of U.S. ESG funds lag broader indexes,
investor interest is shrinking. According to data from
Morningstar Inc. <MORN.O>, the average U.S. ESG-focused ETF has
gained only 11% so far this year, compared to 27.6% for the
Standard & Poor's 500 index. The number of ESG funds in the U.S.
fell 8% in the first nine months of 2024 to only 595, with some
closing and others abandoning their ESG mandate. 
    Some segments are struggling more than others: Morningstar
reported last month that U.S. climate funds are likely to see
their first year of net outflows this year since it began
tracking them as a separate category in 2018.
    ""Clearly the environment is not favorable to this type of
new offering, with closures exceeding launches,"" said Hortense
Bioy, London-based global director of sustainability research
for Morningstar. 
    But Benjamin Allen, CEO of Parnassus, says the 40-year-old
firm has ridden out other cycles and remains focused on picking
high-quality companies that also consider the impact of their
decisions on environmental and social issues on long-term
returns. According to the Parnassus website, comparable mutual
funds have posted gains of 17% to 22% so far this year. 
    ""This is not virtue-signaling; this has a material impact on
returns,"" he told Reuters.
    Information on the holdings of the new ETFs, the Parnassus
Core Select ETF <PRCS.N> and the Parnassus Value Select ETF
<PRVS.N> will not be available until after their launch. Allen
said he expects there to be overlap between each ETF and similar
long-established mutual funds, although the ETFs will have no
more than 25 holdings.
    The $30 billion Parnassus Core Equity Fund mutual fund
includes positions in stocks like Nvidia <NVDA.O> and Microsoft
<MSFT.O>, as well as Intercontinental Exchange <ICE.N> and Waste
Management <WM.N>. The $5.1 billion Parnassus Value Equity Fund
owns stakes in Bank of America <BAC.N> and Deere & Co. <DE.N>.

       Nov 8 (Reuters) - California regulators voted on Friday
to toughen a policy aimed at boosting low-carbon fuels to slash
greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector and meet
state climate change goals, despite criticism it would increase
retail fuel prices.
    The 14-member California Air Resources Board voted 12 to 2
to approve changes to the state's influential Low Carbon Fuel
Standard (LCFS). The vote followed nearly eight hours of
testimony from supporters and opponents of the program, as well
as a lengthy debate among board members. 
    Several members said the changes were essential to
preserving Democrat-led California's climate leadership
following Donald Trump's presidential victory. Trump, a
Republican, has pledged to rescind California's ability to set
its own vehicle emission rules, as he did during his first term
as U.S. president.
    ""The world is watching California to see if we will maintain
leadership or fracture under internal pressure for
perfectionism,"" state Senator Henry Stern, a non-voting board
member, said in a statement read at the meeting by fellow board
member Hector De La Torre.
    ""California has a long history of enacting visionary and
affordable climate policies that are durable enough to endure
major shifts in national politics like we just witnessed.""
    The amendments to the LCFS, which has been in place since
2011, would require a deeper reduction in the carbon intensity
of transportation fuels by 2030 in order for fuel producers to
earn the program's tradable credits.
    Transportation accounts for about 50% of the state's
greenhouse gas emissions.
    While biofuel producers and some state climate advocates
backed the changes, critics including oil companies and consumer
advocates said the change would increase gasoline costs for
Californians. Environmental groups also argued that the policy
would extend the production of oil and gas and prioritize fuels
made from food crops and large dairy operations instead of
encouraging a transition to electric vehicles.
    The LCFS requires fuel makers to buy tradable credits if
their products generate more carbon emissions than a baseline
set by regulators at the air resources board. Refiners that
produce low-carbon fuels and gases can generate the credits to
sell.
    The policy set off a boom in renewable diesel and biogas
production in recent years that has sent credit prices down to
around $70 from above $200 in 2020. The policy revisions are
meant to prop up credit prices and encourage more low-carbon
fuel production.   
    As a result of the board's vote, the LCFS will require a 30%
reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by
2030, up from 20%. The revisions will add a 90% carbon intensity
reduction goal by 2045.
    Developers of projects that produce renewable fuels from
organic waste supported the measures.
    Opponents voiced concern, however, about the potential for
higher gasoline prices.
    In an analysis released last year, the board said the
changes could increase the price of gasoline by 37 cents a
gallon, on average, from 2024 through 2030. But the board has
since said models cannot accurately predict future fuel prices.
    The board's internal environmental justice advisory
committee had urged it to reject the revisions, citing an
exemption for jet fuel producers and large subsidies for dairy
methane projects, among other concerns.

annual revenue forecast on Monday following upbeat third-quarter
results, driven by higher market prices for its recyclable
commodities and increased landfill volumes.
    Shares of the company rose by 2% after the bell.   
    The company now sees its revenue growth for 2024 at 6%,
surpassing the high end of its previous projection of 5.75%.    
    Its total revenue for the quarter ended September 30 rose
about 7.9% to $5.61 billion and was driven by a core price
increase of 6.5%, a key performance metric that reflects changes
in pricing.
    WM, which collects and transfers trash to company landfills
and recycles it into clean, renewable energy, was able to
maintain high prices due to the essential nature of its waste
management services.
    The Houston, Texas-based company posted a quarterly adjusted
profit of $1.96 per share, ahead of analysts' average
expectation of $1.89 per share, according to data compiled by
LSEG.    
    The company has benefited from the use of automation, which
has cut labor costs and boosted efficiency.
    ""Our investments in technology, our fleet, and our asset
network, combined with our disciplined pricing programs, are
expanding the spread between price growth and our cost to
serve,"" CEO Jim Fish said.
    Waste Management and Republic Services <RSG.N> are two major
companies that lead garbage collection across significant
regions of the United States, alongside municipal waste
departments.

narrowly missed quarterly profit and revenue estimates on
Wednesday as higher expenses and marginally lower volumes offset
gains from higher prices for garbage collection and disposal.
    WM - which collects, transfers and recycles trash into
clean, renewable energy - was able to sustain high prices due to
the essential nature of its waste management services.
    Expenses in the quarter rose 5.2% year-over-year for the

and disposal, which accounted for 92% of the company's revenue
in 2023, declined 0.3%.

apart from municipal waste departments — that dominate garbage

expressed are his own.)
    By Robert Cyran
       NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - One company’s
trash may be another company’s treasure, but Waste Management
<WM.N> is overestimating its haul from a dumpster dive. The
garbage collector agreed on Monday to buy Stericycle <SRCL.O>, a
biowaste disposal and document destruction company, for $7.2
billion, including net debt. Unless the buyer can use its market
size to sweep up some pricing power, the deal amounts mostly to
scraps.
    Covid-19 delivered mixed results for Stericycle. Discarded
vaccination needles and drugs injected profit into the medical
business, which accounted for two-thirds of revenue last year.
Volume should keep growing from a post-pandemic reversion as
populations age and safety regulations become more stringent.
The top line’s other one-third comes from making tatters of
personal and private papers, following the 2015 acquisition of
Shred-It International. Increased work from home and use of
electronic documents probably means a steady decline for the
service.
    Stericycle is selling itself for $62 a share, about where
the stock was trading in early 2020 and nearly a 60% discount to
its late 2015 peak. Even then, however, Waste Management isn’t
exactly cleaning up. Its target is projected to generate about
$380 million of operating profit in 2025, according to estimates
gathered by LSEG. After adding $125 million of projected deal
synergies and taxing the sum at the statutory rate, there should
be roughly $400 million of net operating profit after tax.
Divided by the price tag being paid for the enterprise implies a
5.5% return on investment, below the 8.2% weighted average cost
of capital that Morningstar analysts tabulate for Stericycle.
    By taking over a peer, Waste Management might be able to
charge customers more, which would help justify the 39% premium
to Stericycle’s undisturbed price on May 23 when news first
surfaced about a possible sale. If it’s part of the strategy,
however, it probably will attract the attention of trustbusters.
The U.S. Department of Justice forced Waste Management to divest
assets in 2020 when it bought Advanced Disposal Services because
of its already sprawling portfolio of landfills and transfer
stations. Stericycle’s medical specialty could ease any
regulatory concerns, too, but a nearly 5% drop in Waste
Management’s stock price – or about $4 billion of market value –
suggests investors consider the deal less treasure than trash.

    CONTEXT NEWS 
    Waste Management said on June 3 it had agreed to buy
Stericycle for $5.8 billion, or $62 a share, a 20% premium to
the closing price on May 31. The value of the deal, including
$1.4 billion of net debt, is $7.2 billion.
    Two-thirds of Stericycle’s $2.7 billion of revenue in 2023
came from its medical waste division, and the rest from
shredding and recycling confidential documents.
    Waste Management expects to generate more than $125 million
of annual synergies by cutting costs and improving Stericycle’s
logistics.

    By Nathan Gomes
       June 3 (Reuters) - Waste Management said on Monday it
will take Stericycle <SRCL.O> private in a deal valued at $7.2
billion, as it looks to tap into the growing healthcare waste
disposal market in the United States.
    Shares of Stericycle jumped nearly 15% in early trade on
Waste Management's $62 per share offer, which represents an
equity value of $5.75 billion for Stericycle and an about 20%
premium to the stock's Friday close.
    Garbage disposal firms are riding a steady wave of demand
spurred by an uptick in urbanization and industrialization. 
    The North America waste management market size is expected
to rise to $229.3 billion by 2027 from $208.0 billion in 2019,
according to a data analysis from Allied Market Research.
    WM, which dominates the garbage collection space in the
United States, is looking to widen its horizons with Stericycle
that helps clinics, surgery centers and hospitals dispose of
their biohazardous and pharmaceutical waste.
    Analysts at Oppenheimer expect Stericycle's assets to be an
""appealing"" addition to WM, given the latter's limited footprint
in the healthcare industry.
    The Waste Management-Stericycle deal, expected to close by
the fourth quarter of the year, will generate more than $125
million in annual cost cuts, and be accretive to WM's earnings
and cash flows within one year of its close.
    In May, Reuters reported that WM, which collects trash and
recycles it into clean, renewable energy, was also exploring a
sale of its renewable natural gas business that could be worth
about $3 billion, citing people familiar with the matter.
    Shares on WM, which recently signed a sustainability
partnership with Major League Baseball, fell about 2% on Monday,
but have risen nearly 18% this year. 
    The company beat analysts' estimates for first-quarter
profit in April, aided by higher prices and steady demand.
    Centerview Partners LLC served as WM's financial adviser,
while Vinson & Elkins L.L.P and Baker Botts L.L.P served as its
legal counsel.

       June 2 (Reuters) - Waste Management <WM.N> is nearing a
deal to buy medical waste disposal company Stericycle <SRCL.O>
for roughly $7 billion, including debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported on Sunday. 
    The acquisition of Bannockburn, Illinois-based Stericycle

while Houston, Texas-based Waste Management is one of the
largest U.S. trash and recycling collection companies.

       May 22 (Reuters) - In past newsletters I cited a review
by the top U.S. energy regulator about whether asset managers
have gotten too big, but that review is almost philosophical in
the questions it is raising about the power of BlackRock and
other big fund firms.

But now a different matter before the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) has drawn some practical questions
about a deal BlackRock put together in January.

A deal-within-a-deal turns heads
BlackRock says its planned $12.5 billion deal to buy Global
Infrastructure Partners (GIP) will make the fund firm a major
player in energy development. But it has also fueled concerns
about BlackRock's reach given its role as the world's biggest
asset manager running some $10.5 trillion at the end of March.
    
BlackRock says the deal won't close until the third quarter.
Meanwhile an agreement that GIP struck on May 6 has caught the
attention of consumer groups. GIP joined another investor to
take Minnesota-based energy company ALLETE <ALE.N> private at a
$6.2 billion valuation to help it raise money for renewables.

    Advocacy group Public Citizen
     has said in filings to FERC that the deal for ALLETE  puts
BlackRock in a position to exercise active control over power
market assets, giving it a say on matters like rate-setting, and
a change from its traditional role as a passive investor.
  
        
  
For instance, the group noted how BlackRock controls around 9%
of both Cleveland Cliffs <CLF.N> and U.S. Steel. <X.N> Both
operate mining facilities that together represent 70% of
industrial demand for ALLETE's Minnesota Power division, and
BlackRock itself controls some 13% of ALLETE's voting shares. 
    
    That ownership pattern raises potential conflicts that
deserve scrutiny from FERC, said Tyson Slocum, a Public Citizen
director in an interview. An example, he said, is whether
BlackRock would be able to vote on a shareholder resolution
calling on either steelmaker to 
    decarbonize production
    , which might reduce ALLETE's power sales.
  

    While Slocum said it was not clear FERC should block either
deal, the body should review the authorizations it 
    previously granted BlackRock
     to own major shares of utilities as a passive investor.
  
    
""What's coming to a head here is whether BlackRock can exist as
the world's largest investment manager and as an owner and
controller of physical infrastructure assets,"" Slocum said. ""I
don't see how BlackRock can navigate both of those
simultaneously.""
    
    GIP and ALLETE declined to comment. FERC representatives did
not respond to questions. Cleveland Cliffs and U.S. Steel did
not immediately comment. 
  
    
    In a May 10 filing to FERC, attorneys representing GIP said
they would submit a separate application ""at some point in the
future"" where questions about the competitive impact of the
ALLETE deal belong. They asked FERC to authorize the GIP deal
with BlackRock by June 10, as previously requested.    
    
BlackRock declined to comment on its pending acquisition.
BlackRock says it has policies to ""mitigate perceived or
potential conflicts"" such as  maintaining proxy voting
guidelines and where needed, hiring an independent voting
service.     
    
    At its annual shareholder meeting on March 15 CEO Larry Fink
said the GIP deal ""will propel our leadership in the
fast-growing market for hard asset infrastructure.""

executive of its archrival BlackRock.<BLK.N> Look for Ramji to
try to grow the Pennsylvania firm's assets, now some $9
trillion, to become more than those of BlackRock, which ran
$10.5 trillion at the end of March.

I've said before that Exxon's <XOM.N> May 29 annual meeting
looks like  a test of how much support small investors can

Exxon directors over the energy giant's suit against activist
investors. 

Speaking of oil company meetings, May 29 is also the day of
Chevron's <CVX.N> AGM. Listen to see if it provides an update on
its arbitration with Exxon over its proposed Hess acquisition.

       May 16 (Reuters) - Waste management firm WM <WM.N> is
exploring a sale of its renewable natural gas business that
could be worth about $3 billion, according to people familiar
with the matter.
    The Houston-based company is working with JPMorgan Chase &
Co <JPM.N> to gauge interest from potential buyers, which could
include energy companies and private equity firms, the sources
said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential. 
    WM is planning to offload the rights to develop RNG
operations on 115 landfills that it owns, the sources said,
adding the company would retain ownership of the landfills. RNG
is methane captured from biological waste and converted into
electricity or fuel. 
    If the deal talks conclude successfully, it would mark one
of the biggest-ever asset sales in the nascent U.S. RNG
industry. The largest sale was BP's <BP.L> $4.1 billion takeover
of Archaea Energy in 2022.
    ""We are always looking for ways to maximize the value of our
renewable energy business for our shareholders, which may range
from organic growth initiatives to partnerships or monetization
through a sale,"" WM said in a statement. 
    JPMorgan declined to comment.  
    WM had planned to invest about $1.2 billion between 2022 and
2025 to grow the RNG business. The firm now wants to spend that
capital in other areas, the sources said. 
    The company had forecast the RNG unit would contribute more
than $500 million of adjusted earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by 2026. It currently
generates about $150 million of EBITDA, according to the
sources. 
    WM is hoping the unit's valuation would be comparable to, or
exceed, the earnings multiple at which Morrow Renewables sold
RNG operations at landfills to Enbridge <ENB.TO> in late 2023,
the sources added. Should it meet that valuation, WM will get in
the ballpark of $3 billion, the sources said.
    RNG's environmental benefits include the reduction of
natural gas usage and capturing climate-warming emissions that
would otherwise escape into the atmosphere. However, it is more
expensive than natural gas, which is also experiencing a period
of prolonged low prices.
    WM, whose shares have risen by about 25% over the past year,
is one of the largest U.S. trash and recycling collection
companies. The firm's fleet includes more than 12,000 trucks
running on compressed natural gas and it recently signed a
sustainability partnership with Major League Baseball.

       April 30 (Reuters) - Republic Services <RSG.N> reported
first-quarter profit above Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, as
it benefited from price hikes amid sustained demand for waste
collection and disposal.
    The waste management firm reported a profit of $1.44 per
share, 9 cents above analysts' estimates, according to LSEG
data, due to ""continued pricing in excess of cost inflation.
    First-quarter revenue of $3.86 billion was 7.8% higher than
last year, with the company having raised prices by 7% on its
services, even as volumes decreased by nearly 1% year-on-year. 
    Republic Services and WM <WM.N> are the two leading
companies in the U.S. waste services industry. Along with
municipal waste departments, they dominate garbage collection
from residences in the country.
    Shares of the company were up about 1% in trading after the

beat analysts' estimates for first-quarter profit on Wednesday,
helped by higher prices and steady demand for garbage collection
and disposal.
    WM, which collects trash, transfers it to company landfills,
and recycles it into clean, renewable energy, was able to
sustain high prices due to the essential nature of its waste
management services.
    Core prices, a performance metric used by the company to
signify price changes, increased 7.2% for the first quarter.
    WM and Republic Services are two major companies — apart
from municipal waste departments — that dominate garbage
collection in large parts of the United States.
    The Houston, Texas-based company posted adjusted quarterly
profit of $1.75 per share, ahead of analysts' average
expectation of $1.51 per share, according to LSEG data.
    WM also benefited from the use of automation, which has
reduced labor costs and increased efficiency.
    The company said it expects 2024 free cash flow to be
between $2 billion and $2.15 billion. It also expects annual
revenue to increase 5% to 5.57% from prior year.
    Its total revenue in the quarter ended March 31 rose 5.5% to
$5.16 billion.
