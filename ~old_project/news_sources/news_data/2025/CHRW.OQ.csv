2025,CHRW.OQ,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250320:nL4N3Q20UM:4,2025-03-20 10:38:33.000,US companies race to secure import tariff exemptions after Trump pause,"By Abhinav Parmar
       March 20 (Reuters) - Washington's temporary relief for
import tariffs on goods covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement (USMCA) has triggered a spike in US companies seeking
exemption under the trade deal, industry experts said.
    The White House slapped fresh 25% tariffs on goods from
Canada and Mexico on March 5, but later announced that levies on
goods covered under the USMCA would be delayed until April 2.
    The USMCA grants preferential treatment to goods either
sourced from or having a minimum percentage of value added in
any of the three countries.
    ""We're seeing importers rush to become USMCA certified ...
the risk is just too high not to,"" said Brian Riley, senior vice
president of customs house brokerage at logistics firm GEODIS.
    Some of the companies, mostly small businesses reliant on
cross-border trade, are scrambling to verify if their products
already qualify for exemptions.
    At present, only 37.8% of imports from Canada and 48.9% from
Mexico are eligible for duty-free status under the USMCA, an S&P
Global Market Intelligence report showed.
    To qualify, an importer must analyze the bill of materials -
a list of all parts and materials used in a product - to
determine if their goods meet requirements.
    Mike Short, president of Global Forwarding at freight
forwarder C.H. Robinson, said there was an increase of USMCA
qualification and tariff classification requests even before the
official announcement.  
    ""Now that the official amendments are published, these
requests have only increased, and we expect this trend to
continue.""
    Businesses earlier refrained from getting the certification
due to its complexity and costs of meeting requirements,
especially since their goods were already entering the U.S. duty
free.
    Even after certification, a company has to maintain detailed
records for up to five years after import and ensure continued
compliance.
    ""Companies are hedging their bets by becoming USMCA
certified because what's to say the exemption may not continue
after April 2? Or, if the exemption expires then, what if it
returns in the near future?"" GEODIS' Riley said.
    The uncertainty has prompted companies to overlook immediate
cost-savings.
    ""If you are slapping 25-50% tariffs on everything, companies
that never previously needed to are now forced to evaluate if
this (USMCA certification) is an option,"" said Sung Choi,
vice-president of product management at supply chain solutions
provider e2open.

2025,CHRW.OQ,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250306:nL3N3PP19P:1,2025-03-06 17:42:39.000,"Tariff deadline set off spike in cross-border trucking rates, data shows","By Abhinav Parmar and Lisa Baertlein
       March 6 (Reuters) - Rates for cross-border trucking to
and from the U.S. jumped in the lead up to President Donald
Trump's new tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as companies scrambled
to accelerate shipments ahead of an expected increase in costs. 
    It marked a brief moment in the sun for the U.S. trucking
industry after a down cycle that has now lasted for nearly three
years, the longest and deepest since the global financial
crisis. Weak demand and a surplus of trucks on the road were to
blame for the low rates.
    The 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada took
effect on Tuesday, though some automakers received a one-month
reprieve.
    In the past two weeks, spot rates from U.S. to Canada for
dry vans and refrigerated trucks and containers hit a two-year
high, having risen 18% and 35%, respectively, since the November
election, data from DAT freight & analytics <ROP.O> showed.
    Load volumes for dry vans on the Toronto to Chicago route
surged 57% week-over-week before the tariff deadline. 
    ""There's clear evidence shippers north of the border were
desperate to get loads into the U.S. before midnight on Monday
this week,"" said Dean Croke, principal analyst at DAT.
    Rates will likely reverse once the new duties are imposed,
Croke added. ""Uncertainty in the manufacturing sector due to
tariffs will most likely dampen demand even further and
therefore reduce truckload volumes in the process.""
    In the southern border city of Laredo, Texas, the volume of
loads being moved by DAT's carrier network increased 12% last
week, suggesting companies made a last-ditch effort to get loads
into the U.S. at the eleventh hour.
    The refrigerated goods market saw volumes rise 35% on a
weekly basis, driven by an increase in produce crossing into the
McAllen freight market in Pharr Texas.
    On a month-over-month basis, volumes and rates for dry vans
moving from Mexico to U.S. were up 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively,
a smaller jump compared with the Canadian border.
    ""Dry freight Mexican shippers did not appear to react the
same way except for produce shippers,"" Croke said.
    However, experts expect the current volatility in rates to
disappear and volumes to drop quickly as tariffs are imposed.
    ""It's possible many shippers will be cautious about new
orders the first few days after tariffs are implemented to gauge
if the tariffs are temporary,"" said C.H. Robinson's Global
Forwarding president, Mike Short.
    Trucking and delivery firms such as J.B. Hunt <JBHT.O> and
United Parcel Service <UPS.N> are some of the U.S. firms exposed
to tariff-related revenue downturns that will impact almost
every transportation company in the country.
