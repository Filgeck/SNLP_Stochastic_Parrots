       Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. utility CenterPoint Energy
<CNP.N> on Thursday added $500 million to its 10-year capital
expenditure plan to strengthen its electricity grid to handle
the surging demand for power from new data centers.
    Power demand from U.S. data centers is expected to nearly
triple in the next three years and consume as much as 12% of the
total electricity produced, according to a study by Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory.
    CenterPoint expects demand to jump nearly 50% by 2031 in the
Houston electric service territory, and on Thursday increased
its capital plan through 2030 to $47.5 billion to improve grid
resilience.
    ""Like our peers, we have experienced an unprecedented level
of interest in connecting to our grid...we have received
approximately 40 gigawatts in load interconnection requests,""
CenterPoint CFO Christopher Foster said in a conference call.
    Peers Dominion Energy <D.N>, Duke Energy <DUK.N> and DTE
Energy <DTE.N> also raised their capital expenditure plans over
the last month to accommodate the rising power demand from data
centers.
    Utilities were among the biggest winners in the S&P 500 last
year on expectations of surging demand from data centers. The
S&P index tracking utilities <.SPLRCU> rose 19.6% in 2024.
    CenterPoint also reaffirmed its 2025 profit forecast between
$1.74 and $1.76 per share after matching Wall Street
expectations for fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 40 cents
per share.
    The company's quarterly net income rose to $248 million, or
38 cents per share, from $192 million, or 30 cents per share, a
year earlier.

    By Arathy Somasekhar and Marianna Parraga
       HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Several Texas ports began to
resume operations on Wednesday, after winter storm Enzo moved
out of the state, according to ports and a shipping notice seen
by Reuters.    
        The storm brought several inches of snow to Texas,
Louisiana and Florida, where extreme winter conditions are rare.
It forced the shutdown of school districts, businesses and roads
in large cities including Houston and New Orleans, but has so
far caused minor interruptions to energy operations. 
    The port of Freeport resumed vessel operations on Wednesday
morning, while the port of Corpus Christi said ship traffic was
moving after reopening on Tuesday. The ports of Houston and
Galveston were planning to reopen to vessel traffic later in the
day, according to shipping notices and their own reports. 
        Several Texas ports had reduced ship movements on
Tuesday, with Houston also closing all eight public facilities
amid low temperatures and snow.  
    Galveston ship pilots, who assist in moving vessels around
ports, were looking to resume services on Wednesday afternoon
after suspending vessel activity late on Monday, said Rodger
Rees, CEO of Galveston Wharves. Cruise operations were not
affected.
    In Louisiana, the Lake Charles pilots said on Wednesday
their service remained suspended. Vessel movements at the Port
of New Orleans were not anticipated to begin until Thursday, a
shipping agency advisory said, citing the New Orleans Board of
Trade.  
    Ports of Freeport, Houston and Lake Charles did not
immediately reply to requests for comment. 
    Liquefaction operations at Freeport LNG's plants were taken
offline on Tuesday due to intermittent power supply, but feedgas
to the facility was ramping up on Wednesday and repairs had been
completed by electricity provider CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N> to
restore service to Quintana Island, where the Freeport LNG plant
is located, officials at the power company said. 
    Power outages in Texas and Louisiana were declining, with
about 14,000 customers without power on Wednesday, down from
more than 40,000 late on Tuesday, according to Poweroutage.us.
        Texas power grid administrator ERCOT said on Wednesday
the grid had ""sufficient resources"" to meet demand, so supply
was expected to be normal.

    By Scott DiSavino
       Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas company
Freeport LNG said on Wednesday it closed its export plant in
Texas on Tuesday due to a power feed problem during a winter
storm and will keep it shut until power supply stabilizes.
    ""Freeport LNG's liquefaction production operations have been
taken offline due to intermittent CenterPoint Energy power
interruptions beginning early Tuesday morning,"" Freeport LNG
told Reuters in an email.
    ""Our liquefaction production operations will remain offline
until power transmission conditions stabilize,"" it added.
    Officials at U.S. energy company CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N>
said its crews completed repairs and restored service to
customers on Quintana Island who had experienced disruptions on
Tuesday due to the storm.
        The Freeport LNG plant is located in Quintana Island.
Freeport is the only U.S. LNG plant that relies on the power
grid to operate. This allows it to reduce its carbon footprint
but has made it more susceptible to weather events. Last winter
a storm caused 
    damage to the plant's motors
     leading to reduced output for several months.
  
    CenterPoint said in a press release on Tuesday that more
than 99.9% of its customers continue to have power across the
Greater Houston area and crews were continuing to respond to
scattered customer outages.
    PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages, said there were
roughly 16,000 homes and businesses without power in Texas at
around 8:17 a.m. EST (1317 GMT) on Wednesday, with around 3,700
of those out in CenterPoint's territory. 
    CenterPoint has said it provides power to around 2.8 million
customers in Texas.
    Freeport LNG is one of the most closely watched LNG export
plants in the world because the start-up and halting of its
operations often cause price swings in global gas markets.
    Gas was trading around a 14-month high of $15 per million
British thermal units at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF)
benchmark in Europe <TRNLTTFMc1> due in part to the Freeport
outage. [NG/EU]
    When flows to Freeport drop, gas prices in the United States
usually decline due to the export plant's lower demand for the
fuel, while prices in Europe usually increase due to a drop in
LNG supplies available to global markets from the plant.
    Financial firm LSEG said the amount of gas flowing to the
eight big U.S. LNG export plants has risen to an average 15.0
billion cubic feet per day so far in January from 14.4 bcfd in
December. That compares with a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd
in December 2023.
    On a daily basis however, LNG feedgas dropped by 2.3 bcfd to
a six-week low of 13.3 bcfd on Tuesday, due mostly to the
Freeport outage.
    Flows to Freeport were on track to rise to 0.3 bcfd on
Wednesday, up from near zero on Tuesday, according to LSEG data.
That compares with an average of 1.9 bcfd during the prior week.
    One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about 5
million U.S. homes for a day.

       Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas demand is on track
to reach a record high on Tuesday, as extreme cold hits much of
the U.S., stressing power grids and some oil and gas operations.
    The February natural gas contract <NGc1> closed at its
highest level since Dec. 30, 2022 last week as cold weather over
the weekend was on track to cut output by freezing gas wells and
pipes and boosting usage of the fuel to heat homes and
businesses.
    In the spot market, prices rose at several hubs, with the
U.S. Henry Hub benchmark <NG-W-HH-SNL> in Louisiana more than
doubling from Friday to hit $9.86 per MMBtu. Transco Z6 in New
York <NG-CG-NY-SNL> increased more than nine-fold from Friday to
hit 42.855 MMBtu.
    Financial firm LSEG is forecasting total gas use, including
exports, will soar to 166.9 bcfd on Monday and is expected to
rise to 170 bcf bcfd on Tuesday. If that happens, demand on Jan.
21 would top the current daily record high of 168.4 bcfd, hit on
Jan. 16, 2024.
    ""Demand is expected to be very high and it will lead to a
sizable storage draw for this week... production will be reduced
due to wellhead freeze-offs even though at this point it is hard
to estimate how much gas will be off,"" said Zhen Zhu, managing
consultant at C.H. Guernsey and Company in Oklahoma City.
    North Dakota associated wellhead natural gas production was
estimated to be down 0.35-0.43 bcfd on Monday, due to extreme
cold, the state pipeline authority said.
    The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which
operates the power grid for most of the state, issued a weather
watch for Jan. 20-23 due to extreme cold. ERCOT, however, said
it expects normal grid conditions during a weather watch.
    PJM Interconnection, the nation's biggest power grid that
oversees all or parts of 13 states from Illinois to New Jersey,
issued a cold weather alert for Jan. 20-22, with electricity
demand to rise to an all-time winter peak.
    CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N> has activated its emergency
operations center and three staging sites in preparation for
potential power outages from Winter Storm Enzo, the
Houston-based company said on Monday.
    Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48
U.S. states fell from 104.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in
December to 103 bcfd so far in January due mostly to
freeze-offs.

    By Scott DiSavino
       Jan 3 (Reuters) - Freezing weather and snow storms
across the U.S. could cause massive power outages over the next
week and boost natural gas demand to its highest levels of the
winter, according to energy analysts and reliability
coordinators.
    The bump in demand comes as supplies of gas could drop due
to the freezing of oil and gas wells and pipes, known in the
energy industry as so-called ""freeze-offs.""
    Gas provides about 43% of the nation's power generation and
heats about 45% of the country's homes, according to data from
the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The jump in
demand coupled with a drop in supply could drive up prices next
week. 
    ""Appalachia and Rockies production face freeze-off risks as
temperatures drop into the single digits or below,"" analysts at
energy consulting firm Gelber and Associates said in a note.
    The U.S. produces about 105 billion cubic feet per day
(bcfd) of gas with about a third of that supply coming from the
Appalachia region of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio,
according to data from financial firm LSEG and the EIA.
    In past winters, freeze-offs have slashed gas output by
massive amounts, including the loss of around 16.5 bcfd in
January 2024, according to data from LSEG. 
    Frigid temperatures in December 2022 cut supplies by 19.4
bcfd, and in February 2021 hit output by 20.4 bcfd, according to
LSEG data. 
    One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about five
million homes for a day.
    As heating demand picks up, LSEG projects total U.S. gas
use, including exports, could reach 156.4 bcfd on Jan. 9. That
compares with the nation's daily record of 168.4 bcfd hit on
Jan. 16, 2024 during another brutal winter freeze.
    The combination of soaring demand and freeze-offs in January
2024 boosted spot gas prices at the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark
<NG-W-HH-SNL> in Louisiana to over $13 per million British
thermal units (mmBtu).
    Next-day prices at the Henry Hub were currently around $3.65
per mmBtu, the highest levels since January 2024.
    
    POWER COMPANIES PREPARE 
    Some 250 million people will feel frigid air across 40
states in the next week, according to meteorologists at
AccuWeather. They warned of significant ice accumulations that
could cause power outages in parts of Missouri, Illinois,
Indiana, and Kentucky over the weekend and through Monday. 
    U.S. energy company CenterPoint Energy <CNP.N> on Friday
said its cold weather action plan was in place for power and gas
customers in several states, including Texas, Louisiana,
Indiana, Ohio and Mississippi.
    Earlier this week, the North American Electric Reliability
Corp (NERC), the nation's reliability coordinator, urged
everyone in the electricity supply chain to take steps now to
ensure the highest levels of reliability.
    NERC said it is ""especially concerned about natural gas
supply given the significant amount of production in the
mid-Atlantic and Northeast.""
    Extreme weather in February in 2021 left millions in Texas
without power, water and heat for days and resulted in over 200
deaths as the state's power grid scrambled to prevent the
electric system from collapsing.
