fourth-quarter profit estimates owing to sustained demand for
pool maintenance services, especially in Florida on the back of
damages caused by hurricanes.
    The Covington, Louisiana-based company bills itself as the
world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies
and equipment and also sells irrigation and landscape products.
    The company's quarterly adjusted profit was 97 cents per
share, beating analysts' estimate of 90 cents, according to
LSEG-compiled data.
    Pool's shares rose 1.7% before the bell.
    ""Maintenance activities remained stable throughout 2024,
reflecting steady demand for non-discretionary products, while
sales of discretionary products for new pool construction and
remodeling were softer, impacted by macroeconomic conditions,""
Pool Corp noted.
    The pool products distributor sees profit per share for the
year at between $11.08 and $11.58, compared with its 2024 profit
of $11.30 per share.
    The company's net sales fell 2% to $987.5 million in the
quarter ended December 31. However, they beat estimates of $963
million.
