 : On the marking front we have aggressively promoted the Price Lock Guarantee, and it clearly has reduced churn. And of course our bundling strategy has been effective in New York City as well, where we had more than 325,000 Triple Play subscribers at the end of the quarter for penetration of over 20%.

Robert D: So, Craig, before I get to the capital structure point, the one thing I would encourage you to do is not focus inordinately on subscriber growth on the commercial side. And if you’ll look at our commercial revenue growth, I think the growth is quite substantial, and increasingly we’re going to try to give you better metrics to measure our performance on the commercial side because I think looking at subscribers alone just falls short.

 : And then secondly, on programming expenses, the 6% growth was relatively modest and, you know, after listening to all of the second quarter calls of many of the programmers, we're talking about - it feels like expectations on the programming side are much higher, and I'm just wondering if you can comment on how you expect programming expenses to ramp up, not just for the back half of the year but over the next few years?

Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: I guess I asked it poorly, but if you look at your commercial high speed data sub base, are those customers using 10 lines per business with the telco so that if you can convert them over you've got a lot of revenue to go after?
Robert D: It is certainly the case that a prime target market for us on our phone business is our existing HSB customers, if that's what you're asking.

Richard Greenfield - Pali Research: 
 : And then two, just looking for a view, Univision has now filed for retransmission consent negotiations at the end of this year and wanted to get your perspective on how you think that plays out and how willing you would be to pay cash for carriage of those stations given your markets.
Glenn A: Okay, Rich, I'll do the network DVR and let Rob do the Univision one.

Robert D:
 Marcus:
 : One thing that's worth pointing out is that sequentially in 2007 we had actually a decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3 and pretty modest growth in revenue from Q3 to Q4, so it actually gives us a fairly favorable set of comparisons in the back half of the year. And the last piece is we are expecting some benefit from political advertising as we go into the fourth quarter.
